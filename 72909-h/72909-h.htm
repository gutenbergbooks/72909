<p>In all that vast expanse of country west of Fort
Riley clear to the Sierras of California there are
not over four hundred thousand acres of arable
land.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> extract from McClelland’s report, later
appearing as preface to some fourteen volumes of
Pacific Railroad explorations, evidently acted as
a direct challenge to the pioneering spirit of a
country that was young. Following immediately
upon its publication, as if in a concerted effort of
refutation, the great westward trek across a continent
set in, the determined advance of a land-hungry
horde intent upon seeking out and settling
that four hundred thousand acres of arable
land; and in the brief space of thirty years there
were thirty million acres under fence while the
swarming multitude of hopeful settlers continued
to surge westward across the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Thus do even wise men frequently fail to vision
the immensity of the future which stretches forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
ahead within the puny span of their own remaining
years.</p>

<p>Another few decades and old Joe Hinman,
himself accounted a wise man among his fellows,
sat his horse on a little rise of ground and lamented
his own lack of foresight. Donald Carver,
his younger companion, gazed off across the
flat where several riders held some two thousand
head of steers. Hinman had come with the vanguard
of the invaders and had watched succeeding
waves of home seekers swarm past on all the
ancient trails, the bull trains stretching almost
without a break from the Missouri to the Colorado
hills, when Cheyenne, Kiowa and Comanche
contested the advance at every crossing of the
Republican and the Smoky Hill, at the Great
Bend of the Arkansas, and historic Pawnee
Rock; had watched the bull teams and the prairie
schooner giving way to freight cars that rattled
past on steel rails which spanned a continent.
He had seen the rolling plains of Kansas, once
constituting the first reaches of the Great American
Desert, lifted bodily into statehood and wondrous
fertility, so long since that younger men
had almost forgotten that their native State had
ever been other than a prosperous agricultural
community. While the main tides of settlement
had swept on to the west and north, Hinman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
had turned aside and traveled south on the Chisholm
Trail till he reached a point where the floods
of home seekers were halted by some invisible barrier.
There he had settled and prospered, but
even now, thirty years after driving his first claim
stakes through the prairie sod, that same barrier
resisted all advance. Just outside his dooryard
a vast tract, sixty miles by two hundred in extent,
remained undeveloped and untouched. The land
was rich and beckoned temptingly to those who
sought a scrap of ground which might constitute
a home, yet beyond Hinman’s holdings the
virgin sod extended to the far horizon with never
a ribbon of smoke by day or a twinkling window
by night to indicate the friendly presence of a
settler’s cabin,—the Cherokee Strip, upon which
the white man was forbidden to settle by the
terms of an ancient treaty. This great tract had
been set aside to serve as insulation between warring
whites and reds, its status still the same even
though the necessity for such insulation had been
long since removed,—an empire lying dormant
and awaiting only the magic word which should
strike off the shackles and permit its broad miles
to blossom into productiveness.</p>

<p>“There she lays, son,” Hinman said, waving
an arm in a comprehensive sweep toward the
unowned lands. “Some day right soon they’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
open her. Every land-hungry party in four
States has his eye on the last frontier and whenever
she’s throwed open to settlement you’ll see
one hair-raising mad stampede. So if you’re
going off somewheres, like I heard it rumored,
why I’d cancel the arrangements and sit tight.”</p>

<p>The younger man nodded without comment.</p>

<p>“Fortune always beckons from some place a
long ways remote,” Hinman rambled on.
“When likely she’s roosting right at home, if
only we’d have a look. Now I quit Ohio as a
youngster because there wasn’t any land left
open but hardwood swamp lands, which could be
had for about a dollar an acre, but I couldn’t see
its value at a dollar a mile. To-day that Ohio
swamp land is selling round two hundred an acre
while what ground I’ve got under crop out here
would average right at thirty and raw grassland
not over three or four.”</p>

<p>“But owning the most part of two countries,”
Carver commented, “you can maybe worry
along.”</p>

<p>“Likely,” Hinman confessed. “But that’s
not the point. I could have stayed right at home
with those swamp lands and without ever exerting
myself, except maybe to keep entertained
with a brace of coon hounds, I could have
growed into more wealth by considerable than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
what I’ve accumulated out here by steady work.
That’s the real point; so it appears that my leaving
there was sheer lack of foresight. So it’s
likely that your best chance to get ahead and lay
up an honest dollar is by staying right here instead
of stampeding off somewheres. That’s the
real reason I sent for you.”</p>

<p>“Since I’ve never even considered leaving, and
you well aware of it,” said Carver, grinning,
“then the real reason you sent for me was to
engage me to perform something you didn’t want
to do yourself—which in turn is related to the
possibility of my accumulating an honest dollar.
We’ve rambled all the way from timbered swamp
land on down to the surrounding short grass.
What sort of country lays beyond? My curiosity
is fairly foaming over.”</p>

<p>Hinman regarded him quizzically and Carver
bore the scrunity undisturbed. The older man
knew that Carver was dependable; that once
committed he would follow any mission to its termination
and defend the financial interests of his
employer with every resource at his command.
It was only in his own affairs that he evidenced
supreme carelessness. Older men forgave his
irresponsibility in that quarter and accorded him
a certain measure of respect for the reason that
even in the midst of some bit of recklessness he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
retained an underlying sense of balance and
proportion. And he had worked intermittently
for old Joe Hinman for the past twelve years.</p>

<p>“It’s not that I don’t want to do it myself,”
Hinman denied, reverting to Carver’s mild accusation.
“It’s only that it wouldn’t look right
on the surface. Now whatever property is down
in the Strip is legally non-existent, you might
say, and consequently untaxable,” thereby disproving
his oft-lamented lack of foresight.
“And it’s drawing right close to the first of
March.”</p>

<p>“So you want me to move a thousand head of
steers across the line and hold ’em till after
you’ve been assessed.” Carver hazarded.</p>

<p>“Two thousand, son,” Hinman corrected.
“Two thousand head. You couldn’t hold ’em
in the quarantine belt for long without getting
jumped, but you know the boss of every outfit
off to the south and you could maybe trade deals
with one of them. You’ll know how. It’ll save
me taxes on two thousand head and give me a few
weeks’ free grass. That much for me and a
thousand nice dollars for you if you put it
across.”</p>

<p>“An hour after dark I’ll be shoving those cows
across the line,” Carver promised. “Meantime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
you might advance a hundred. Unfortunately
I’m just out of funds.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” said Hinman, “you’re just
always out.” He counted off the money.
“You’ve worked for me on and off ever since you
was big enough to claw your way up onto a horse
and on some occasions you’ve exercised such fair
average judgment in looking after my affairs
that I’ve wondered why on all occasions you was
such a poor hand to look after your own.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been so taken up with your business that
I’ve sort of let my own interests drift along,”
Carver explained.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“You’re right handy at doing things for me,”
Hinman resumed. “But when it comes to doing
anything for yourself you’re somewhat the most
tinkering, trifling specimen I’ve come acrost.
You really ought to settle on some one job and
stick at it.”</p>

<p>“That’s my one favorite motto,” Carver confessed.
“Stick to your bush—and be exhibited
among the vegetables.”</p>

<p>He turned his eye upon a tumbleweed that
raced madly past before the wind. The dried
skeleton was of the general size and shape of a
pumpkin. Two more of these discontented
wraiths of the prairies hurtled past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>“Now there goes a vegetable with ambitions,”
said Carver. “Every winter the tumbleweed
tribe stages a protest against being mere plants
rooted forever to one spot.” He chanted a few
of the numberless verses of a prairie song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“Our size and shape is similar,”</div>
<div class="verse">Said the tumbleweed to the pumpkin.</div>
<div class="first">“I’ll run you a race from here to there</div>
<div class="verse">And all the way back again.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“I’m a wild free blade of the open,</div>
<div class="verse">The spirit of all unrest.</div>
<div class="verse">I may end up in some worse place</div>
<div class="verse">But I’m going to make the test.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“And I’m the soul of solid content,”</div>
<div class="verse">Said the pumpkin to the weed.</div>
<div class="first">“Rather than take any chance at all</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll stay here and go to seed.”</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">But I’d rather be a traveling weed</div>
<div class="verse">Than a stationary squash.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“I know,” Hinman said. “You’re a pure-bred
tumbleweed and no mistake. But most folks
follow one business, and let the rest alone.”</p>

<p>“And it’s my observation that most folks are
dissatisfied with what they’re working at but keep
on doing it the rest of their natural lives just
to try and vindicate their judgment,” Carver
said. “Now if I don’t settle on one pursuit
there’ll never be any reason for me to be discontented
with my choice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>The old man considered this bit of philosophy.</p>

<p>“If you ever decide to risk a mistake I’ll maybe
help you out to a mild extent,” he said, “provided
you come through with this present little
errand I’m sending you on.”</p>

<p>Carver thanked him, pocketed the bills which
constituted the advance upon his venture, and
headed his horse off to the east. As he rode he
reviewed all possible motives underlying Hinman’s
proposal. Tax-dodging on a smaller scale
was no unusual thing along the line, but he was
morally certain that this motive, though the purported
object of the trip, was entirely secondary
in Hinman’s considerations.</p>

<p>“The taxes won’t amount to half the expenses
of the trip,” Carver reflected. “Now just what
is he aiming at?”</p>

<p>He had reached no satisfactory solution when,
an hour later, the squat buildings of Caldwell
loomed before him. He dismissed the problem
temporarily. As he rode down the wide main
thoroughfare it seemed that the hand of time had
been turned back two decades to the days of
Abilene, Hayes and Dodge, when each of those
spots in turn had come into its brief day of glory
as the railroad’s end and the enviable reputation
of being the toughest camp on earth. In their
day all those towns had eclipsed the wildest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
heights of wickedness attained by mushroom mining
camps of lurid fame, then had passed on into
the quiet routine of permanent respectability as
the trading centers of prosperous agricultural
communities. But little Caldwell stood unique,
as if she were a throwback to an earlier day, nestling
in the edge of a state where prohibition and
anti-gambling regulations had long prevailed,
yet her saloons stood invitingly open by day and
night and the clatter of chips and the smooth
purr of the ivory ball were never silent in the
halls of chance; for just beyond lay No Man’s
Land, the stamping ground of all those restless
spirits who chafed against restrictive laws that
were not of their own making, and wide-open
Caldwell reaped the harvest of their free-flung
dollars.</p>

<p>Groups of tall-hatted, chap-clad men hailed
Carver from the sidewalk as he rode down the
wide main street. Scores of saddled horses
drowsed at the hitch rails and ranchers’ families
rattled past in buckboards drawn by half-wild
ponies. The street was thronged with blanketed
Indians, for the Government beef issue was parcelled
out semi-monthly on the little hill south of
Caldwell and every two weeks the whole Cherokee
nation made the pilgrimage to receive the
largess of the Great White Father. As if to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
complete the illusion that he had been transported
back to the days of Dodge and Abilene,
Carver could make out the low-hanging pall of
dust which marked the slow progress of a trail herd
moving up from the south along the old
Chisholm Trail, a thoroughfare now paralleled
by the railroad that pierced the Cherokee Strip,
but which was still available to those who would
save freight charges and elected instead to follow
the old-time method of pastoral transportation
in marketing their droves.</p>

<p>Carver left his horse in a lean-to shed in rear
of a two-room frame house in the outskirts of
town. The plot of ground on which it stood,
consisting of three corner lots, had come into his
possession the preceding winter through the medium
of a poker hand. Instead of disposing of
the tract for ten dollars—the amount of chips
which he had risked against it—it had pleased
him to retain it and construct thereon the little
board house, performing the work himself during
leisure hours.</p>

<p>He headed for the swinging doors of the Silver
Dollar, hopeful of finding congenial companionship
even though this was the wrong time of day
for any considerable activity within doors. A
group of men sat along the rear wall and conversed
in listless tones. Here were those upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
whom fortune had failed to smile the preceding
night, waiting for some kindred spirit who, more
favored than themselves, might express a willingness
to relieve their temporary distress.</p>

<p>“It’s high noon and I’ll wager not a man
present has even had his breakfast,” Carver
greeted. “But the rescue squad is here to provide
nourishment for the losers.”</p>

<p>He tendered a crisp bill to Alf Wellman.</p>

<p>“Fill the boys with food,” he invited. “And
in the meantime, while they’re deciding what to
order—” and he motioned toward the polished
bar.</p>

<p>Wellman jerked a casual thumb in the direction
of the three men in the group who were
unknown to Carver.</p>

<p>“These are the Lassiter boys,” he announced
by way of introduction. “Not bad after you
get to knowing ’em.”</p>

<p>The three Lassiters were an oddly assorted
crew; Milt, the eldest, a gaunt, dark man who
spoke but seldom; Noll, a sandy, self-assertive
and unprepossessing individual; while Bart, by
several years their junior, was a big blond youngster
whose genial grin cemented Carver’s instant
friendship.</p>

<p>Noll Lassiter hitched from his chair, his eyes
resting on the bank note in Wellman’s hand, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
as he attained his feet a slight lurch testified to
the fact that even if he had not found food during
the morning hours he had at least found drink.
Being thus fortified his desire for food was now
uppermost.</p>

<p>“Let’s eat,” he said.</p>

<p>“Restrain yourself,” the younger brother admonished.
“The gentleman’s giving a party.
Besides it’s downright harmful to eat breakfast
on an empty stomach—and mine is absolutely
vacant.”</p>

<p>“Worst thing you could do,” Wellman seconded.
“It will show up on a man if he keeps
at it.”</p>

<p>“I expect there have been folks tried it and
went right on living till they got kicked by a
horse or died some other sort of a natural death,”
said Carver. “But what’s the use of taking
chances?”</p>

<p>Noll restrained his urge for food while the host
paid for two rounds, then reverted to his original
contention.</p>

<p>“And now,” said he, “let’s eat.”</p>

<p>“Not until I’ve purchased a return round for
our old friend Carver,” Bart dissented.</p>

<p>“How’re you going to manage it without a
dime in your pockets?” Noll demanded.</p>

<p>“You ought to be familiar with the state of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
my pockets,” the blond youth returned, “having
conducted a thorough search of them and purloined
therefrom my last ten spot before I was
awake. Why didn’t you reserve two bits for
breakfast before you tossed it off on the wheel if
you’re so damn near starved?”</p>

<p>He remained with Carver while the others
followed Wellman through the swinging side
door that led into the adjoining restaurant.</p>

<p>“And now, since Pete here,” said Bart, indicating
the barkeeper, “steadfastly refuses to
open a charge account, I’ll have to do some financing.
Lend me a couple of quarts of your very
worst,” he wheedled. “Not charge, you understand,
but just lend ’em to me for a period of three
minutes. Something round a dollar a quart.”</p>

<p>The bartender selected a brace of black bottles
and shoved them across to Lassiter who moved
with them to a rear door that opened on an alley.
Several blanketed figures prowled this rear
thoroughfare and the copper-hued wards of the
Government converged upon the man in the doorway.
He exchanged the two quarts for two five-dollar
bills, thereby becoming eligible for a protracted
stay within the walls of the penitentiary.</p>

<p>“Now we can start even,” he announced, paying
Pete for the initial stock and retaining the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
surplus. “Quick turns and small profits is my
rule of life.”</p>

<p>“One day you’ll acquire a new rule—long
years and no profits,” predicted the white-aproned
philosopher behind the bar. “Unless
you learn to transact that sort of business by the
dark of the moon.”</p>

<p>“Necessity,” Lassiter advanced in extenuation
of his lack of caution. “Suppose you set us out
a sample of something a few shades more palatable
than what we just peddled to the old chief.”</p>

<p>The two pooled their resources and pursued
their casual carefree way, all sense of responsibility
discarded for the moment, as one might
shed an uncomfortable garment with the idea of
donning it again at some future time. The
youthful Lassiter, who deplored all things serious
while at play, found in Carver a delightful companion
who seemed sufficiently light-minded and
irresponsible to satisfy the most exacting. The
wheel in the Silver Dollar, the faro bank in the
Senate and the crap layout in the Gilded Eagle,
each contributed modestly to their swelling bank
roll in response to a few casual bets. As they left
this last-named resort Bart halted suddenly.
Carver glanced up to determine the cause of this
abrupt halt. Freel, a deputy United States marshal,
had just passed, and Carver, recalling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
incident of the two black bottles, concluded that
Lassiter had decided against meeting the Federal
officer at just that moment lest the news of the
transaction had reached him. Freel walked with
a girl, his hand clasping her arm familiarly as he
piloted her through the crowd. Bart frowned
after the couple.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t let the valiant marshal fret you,”
Carver counselled. “I don’t know much about
him except that he strikes a flat note in me, but I
suspect he’s a pussy-footer and real harmless.
I’ve heard things about Freel.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I know,” said Lassiter. “So’ve
I; and it’s the things I’ve heard which keeps him
on my mind. One day I’ll have to slip my twine
on him and canter off across a few thousand acres
of country with him dangling along behind.”</p>

<p>“Tell me when,” said Carver. “I’ll dab my
noose on his off leg and bounce my horse off the
opposite direction like we was contending for the
biggest piece of a turkey’s wishbone. If half I
hear is true he’s got it coming and folks will hail
us as public benefactors.”</p>

<p>Twice within the next hour Carver noticed Noll
Lassiter conversing with Freel. It was evident,
that, whatever Bart’s grievance against the marshal,
the feeling was not shared by the elder
brother. The mid-afternoon crowd had gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
in the Silver Dollar by the time Carver returned
to the starting place. Men banked deep round
the roulette layout as it was whispered about that
Carver and Bart Lassiter were winning heavily
from the bank. The professional chant of lookout
and croupier rose above the hum of conversation
as the ivory ball purred smoothly round the
wheel of chance. Noll Lassiter shouldered his
way through the crowd and stationed himself
between the two favorites of fortune.</p>

<p>“Luck’s with us,” he genially proclaimed
thereby identifying himself with the winnings.
“We’ll break this wheel between the three of us.
She’s running our way strong.”</p>

<p>Carver suddenly realized that the pair had become
a trio as Noll supplied himself with chips
from the accumulation before the other two.
When these had joined their fellows in the check
rack he appropriated a fresh supply. Carver
was conscious of a growing dislike for this uninvited
partner. He tapped Noll’s hand with a
forefinger as the man reached for a third stack
of chips.</p>

<p>“Try keeping it in your pocket,” he mildly advised.
“It’s as active after chips as a sand rat
after a beetle; and it makes me restless.”</p>

<p>“Half of these chips belong to Bart,” Noll
insisted. But this sudden assumption of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
close-knit bond of brotherhood failed to rouse
any corresponding enthusiasm in the younger
Lassiter.</p>

<p>“You’re blasting our luck,” he asserted. “Not
to say annoying us. Take yourself off somewheres.”</p>

<p>Noll, however, declined to heed this bit of counsel.
Bart and Carver pushed their chips across
the board and cashed in.</p>

<p>“Cheerful companion, Noll is, when he’s packing
a skinful,” Bart commented as the doors of
the Silver Dollar closed behind them. “And
he’s equally genial when he’s sober.”</p>

<p>“Offhand I’d pass unfavorable judgment on
your relative,” Carver confessed. “I don’t see
much family resemblance. How come you’re
brothers?”</p>

<p>“Half-brothers,” Bart amended. “We had
the same father. I came along a dozen years
late. Spoiled younger son, you know. Leastways
I was always spoiled in spots where Noll
had been working on me. When I turned sixteen
I set out to spoil Noll. Since his convalescence
he’s had a notion I might declare another open
season on the dove of peace so we get along
nowadays in regular family style. Say; now
since we’re rolling in wealth you wouldn’t mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
if I held out twenty in case fortune failed us?
It’s not quite the thing to do but——”</p>

<p>“Bury it,” Carver agreed, waving his hesitancy
aside. “Tuck it away somewhere.” He
knew his man and was certain that the twenty was
destined to fill some urgent necessity. “We’ll
never even miss a little piece like that.”</p>

<p>Lassiter led the way to a rooming house above
a store and turned into a dimly lighted room on
one side of the narrow hall. Articles of man’s
attire lay scattered about the place.</p>

<p>“The three of us headquarter here when we’re
in town,” Bart explained. “I’ll plant these two
tens in a dresser drawer.”</p>

<p>He opened the drawer in question and Carver,
standing just to his right, found himself gazing
down upon a scrap of black cloth from which two
eyeholes stared blankly back at him. Lassiter
placed the two gold pieces beneath the old newspaper
with which the drawer was carpeted, closing
it without comment, and they returned to the
street and sought the wheel in the Gilded Eagle.
For a time fortune smiled on them. Then a
reverse tide set in. At the end of an hour each
one shoved a stiff bet upon the board. There was
the usual brief hush as the ball neared the end
of its spin.</p>

<p>“The even losses to the odd and the red defeats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
the black,” the croupier chanted. “The middle
column pays the gambler and the others pay the
house. Place your bets for another turn.” He
twisted the wheel and snapped the ivory marble
in the reverse direction. “The little ivory ball—she
spins! the flitting pill of fortune. Off again
on the giddy whirl.”</p>

<p>He glanced expectantly at the two chief players
but they had explored their pockets and failed
to invoice sufficient resources with which to purchase
a white chip between the two of them.</p>

<p>“Odd how rapid a man can shed it if he sets
out to exert himself,” Carver commented.</p>

<p>Lassiter grinned and turned suddenly toward
the door. It occurred to Carver that the youth
was starting forth to retrieve that twenty-dollar
reserve which was cached in the dresser drawer.</p>

<p>“Don’t you,” he admonished; but Lassiter had
passed out the door.</p>

<p>Carver made a move to follow but met Carl
Mattison, town marshal, coming in.</p>

<p>“You recollect that extra saddle,” Carver
greeted without parley. “The one you was admiring,
with all those silver trappings. If you
still admire it fifty dollars’ worth——”</p>

<p>“Sold,” said the marshal and counted out the
money. “Send it round to my room above the
Boston Store.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“I would,” said Carver, “only my delivery
boy, the shiftless little wart, is out somewhere
spinning his top. Here’s the key to my shack.
You saunter past and collect it.”</p>

<p>Carver headed for Lassiter’s room. The door
stood ajar and as he entered he observed a stooping
figure whose hand was busily exploring the
drawer of the dresser.</p>

<p>“We won’t need that twenty,” Carver said.
“Let her ride where she is.”</p>

<p>The figure straightened and whirled to face
him in the dim light. It was Noll Lassiter, not
Bart.</p>

<p>“Where’s Bart?” Carver asked.</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen him,” Noll returned.</p>

<p>“Then where’s Bart’s twenty dollars?” Carver
inquired. “I mistrust that you’ve got it—and
I want it. S’pose you hand it over.”</p>

<p>“Make it out of here!” Noll ordered. “This
is my room and I don’t want you in it.”</p>

<p>“Someway you haven’t inspired me with any
ardent fancy,” Carver stated. “Right at present
the feeling is mild, but it will grow acute if you
keep exploring in that drawer for Bart’s last
twenty.”</p>

<p>Lassiter made a swift move behind him but his
arms fell back at his sides as Carver’s gun was
jammed suddenly against his floating ribs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>“Tut, tut,” Carver admonished. “You’re
way too awkward for that sort of thing. Sometime
you’ll do that and some excitable soul will
shoot you three or four times while you’re starting
your wind-up.”</p>

<p>He removed Noll’s weapon and tossed both it
and his own upon the bed.</p>

<p>“Now we can converse at our ease until Bart
comes,” he said.</p>

<p>But Lassiter, angered beyond precaution,
jumped for him the instant he relinquished the
weapons, and being heavier than Carver he
sought to bear him down by sheer weight. Carver
rocked his head with two solid smashes but
Noll sought only to come to grips where he could
exert his strength, clutching at his opponent instead
of returning his blows. They fought in
cramped quarters and Carver could not step to
either side lest he should give Lassiter access to
the two guns reposing on the bed. The huge
paws clamped on his shoulders and Lassiter
crushed him back against the dresser. Carver
elevated one knee between them, planted his boot
against the other’s paunch and propelled him
violently doorward. With a single step he retrieved
his gun with intent to discourage Lassiter’s
return, but he had no need of it. The big
man’s head collided forcibly with the door jamb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
and he sprawled in a limp heap just outside in the
narrow corridor.</p>

<p>Bart Lassiter, just mounting the stairway, witnessed
this strange exit of his relative. He
peered inside and discovered Carver, so he entered
and seated himself on the edge of the bed, twisting
a cigarette while he sought to reconcile the
evidence before his eyes with the mental picture
of the empty room as he had left it not five
minutes past.</p>

<p>“Incidentally, there seems to be a corpse on the
threshold,” he presently observed. “What did it
die of?”</p>

<p>“General malignancy that set in right after
birth and just now came to a head,” Carver
diagnosed. “He was prospecting for your cache
when I arrived.”</p>

<p>“He’d already located it,” Bart stated. “It
was gone when I came up. Likely he came back
to hunt for more as I went down, and your trails
converged, sort of. Wellman said you’d just
turned up the stairs, so I came on back.”</p>

<p>He crossed over to inspect the sprawled figure
in the hallway.</p>

<p>“I’d say he was totally defunct,” he reported;
but as if to refute this assertion Noll stirred an
arm and grunted. “Unfortunately resuscitation
is already setting in,” Bart revised his statement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
“Let’s be off before he opens one eye and
tries to borrow ten.”</p>

<p>An hour later the proceeds derived from the
sale of the saddle had faded in the face of the
bank’s per cent and their finances were totally
exhausted except for a few small coins in Carver’s
pocket. Lassiter leaned rather heavily
against the bar in the Silver Dollar and straightened
himself with an effort.</p>

<p>“It’s time for me to dangle,” he announced.
“Hate to break up the party and all that sort
of thing, but I’m overdue right now. Meet you
here in an hour.”</p>

<p>He proceeded toward the door which opened
into the adjoining restaurant but Carver overhauled
him while he was yet some ten feet from
his goal.</p>

<p>“Now don’t you go trickling out on me,” he
reproved. “I’ll be gone in an hour—riding off
for three weeks. Stay with me till then and we’ll
both move out together.”</p>

<p>Lassiter turned uncertainly and Carver, looking
past him, discovered that the swinging door
into the restaurant stood half-open. The young
girl framed in the doorway was gazing straight
into his eyes. Oddly enough his first thought
took the form of an intense desire to expend
large sums of money in buying things for her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
this impulse coupled with a swift regret that
such amounts as he wished to squander were not
for the moment available. The eyes that looked
back into his were gray eyes, bordering on blue;
and he gathered that they regarded him with a
mixture of doubt and pity. He straightened resentfully,
never having been doubted and refusing
to be pitied, flooded with a sense of having
been detected in some bit of wickedness. For
the first time in his life his own eyes dropped
before the direct gaze of another’s yet in his whole
past career there was not one deed for which he
felt any particular regret or shame. He lifted
his eyes again with a hint of defiance, but found
himself staring at the blank swinging door; in
that split-second of averted glance the vision had
disappeared, leaving him with a vague impression
of its unreality,—and with a pronounced disinclination
for continuing the party. Lassiter
had not seen, and Carver dispelled the blond
youth’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“Maybe we’d better call it a day,” he said.
“See you when I get back from the Strip.”</p>

<p>Carver was conscious of a distaste for his surroundings,
once the door had closed behind his
companion. These carousals in town always
palled on him in the end, giving way to the urge
to straddle a horse and be off through the clean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
outdoors while the wind fanned the fumes from
his head, but heretofore this state of mind had
come about through gradual transition instead
of descending upon him in a single second as had
been the case to-day.</p>

<p>He gravitated to the roulette wheel through
force of habit and risked his handful of small
coins, playing absently and placing his bets without
care or consideration. Now just why, he
wondered, had he been struck with a wild wish to
buy things for a girl he had never glimpsed before
in his life. He was not conscious that she
had been shabbily clothed, for to save his immortal
soul he could not have testified to the color,
texture or state of preservation of one single item
of her attire, but someway he felt that she was
needing things and he wanted to see that these
things were provided. He cashed in his few remaining
chips and the banker handed him a single
silver dollar in return.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">II</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Carver</span> repaired to the shack to retrieve his
horse and as he rode back through town he observed
a group round the town well in the center
of the wide main street. Mattison had laid aside
his personal pursuits and had donned his official
rôle of town marshal, in which capacity he was
instructing Bart Lassiter in no uncertain terms
as to the impropriety of watering his horse from
the oaken bucket attached to the well rope.</p>

<p>“Water him from the trough,” he ordered.</p>

<p>“After all those Cherokee ponies have been
dipping their noses in it?” Bart demanded.
“Not this horse.”</p>

<p>“That bucket is for folks,” the marshal patiently
explained.</p>

<p>“An’ this horse is folks,” Lassiter insisted.
He continued to extend the brimming bucket
horseward with his left hand. The spectators
shifted, recalling that Mattison’s predecessor
had fallen in a street fight near this same well.
There was no ill-feeling between the two men,
but neither of them would back down publicly
under pressure. Carver glanced aside as a voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
called Bart’s name. The girl of the Silver Dollar
was peering from a window above a store, her
gaze riveted on the group at the well.</p>

<p>“Here’s two of my friends working up a grievance
over well water,” Carver said, dropping
from his horse. “Wherever did the pair of you
acquire this sudden interest in it? I’m surprised
at you.”</p>

<p>“If this party’s a friend of yours, why you take
him,” said Mattison. “He won’t mind me. Let
him water his horse till the well goes dry.”</p>

<p>“No such thing,” Lassiter gracefully declined.
“I wouldn’t think of letting the critter slosh his
muzzle in the town bucket.”</p>

<p>The marshal moved off and Carver reflected
that the girl’s sudden appearance in the doorway
of the Silver Dollar had been occasioned by Bart
Lassiter’s failure to fulfill his appointment. It
also accounted for Bart’s hesitation as they had
stepped out of the Golden Eagle earlier in the
day. He had halted to avoid meeting the girl,
not to avoid Freel, as Carver had previously supposed;
and Bart’s grievance against Freel rose
from this same source, for undoubtedly the girl
who was being piloted down the street by the
marshal at the moment of their exit was the same
who had later stirred Carver so strangely by her
unexpected appearance in the doorway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>“A lady was calling your name from a window
a minute back,” he said.</p>

<p>“Likely it was Molly,” Bart returned.
“That’s who that ten spot was destined for—the
one Noll lifted first. That twenty I planted
later would also have found its way to her except
for Noll. She’s a sweet kid, Molly, but she’s
worried sick every minute I’m out of sight.”</p>

<p>Carver was conscious of a sense of irritation
toward his friend, a vague resentment at this
implied familiarity between the boy and the lady
of the doorway.</p>

<p>“Then I wouldn’t be letting her wait around,”
he reproved. “Damned if I would.”</p>

<p>“But a man can’t tag his sister every living
second,” Bart expostulated. “I ask you now!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Carver. “Maybe not.” His irritation
had evaporated. “But if she was my sister
I’d put in considerable time with her.”</p>

<p>The brother grinned unrepentantly.</p>

<p>“All right; you do that,” he urged. “Maybe
she’ll take to worrying about you instead of losing
sleep over me. Appears to me like a nice arrangement
for all hands concerned.”</p>

<p>The girl appeared suddenly beside Lassiter
and rested a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Put up your horse and stay here with me,”
she urged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“Can’t, Molly,” Bart declined. “I promised
the boys I’d go and they’re waiting now. We’re
due to help Crowfoot gather a little bunch of beef
stuff to-morrow and we’ll have to ride all night if
we make Turkey Creek by morning.”</p>

<p>The girl turned to Carver.</p>

<p>“Thanks for interceding with your friend the
marshal,” she said. “But please go now.
You’ve had Bart to yourself all day.”</p>

<p>Carver nodded assent, mounted and rode off
down the street. As he passed the Silver Dollar
he felt the single coin in his pocket.</p>

<p>“That’s what I’m capitalized at,” he said.
“Just one little measly silver dollar. That’s my
invoice. This morning I could have added a
horse, a house and an extra saddle to the statement.
Now I’m out the saddle and owe Hinman
a sum sufficient to offset the value of both horse
and house. I’d sell under the hammer for a single
dollar bill. The lady read my face value at a
glance and dismissed me offhand without another
look.”</p>

<p>He saw the two elder Lassiter brothers riding
south at the next street intersection. It was
quite dark when he cleared the town and as he
rode on through the night he was conscious of a
mild dissatisfaction. He drew forth his last coin
and addressed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“I’ve rode into town with a many a dollar on
me,” he said. “But this is about the first time I
ever rode out and packed one away with me.
That shows I’m growing more conservative right
along. You must be a lucky little devil or else
you wouldn’t have stayed with me till I got out
of town.” He slipped the coin back into his
pocket. “Little lonely dollar, you must mount
up to a million.”</p>

<p>He heard the low rumble of animal voices and
knew that Hinman’s cows were being held on the
bed ground somewhere just ahead. The old man
greeted him as he rode up.</p>

<p>“I’m sending Bradshaw and four others with
you,” he announced. “One of the boys is holding
the pack outfit back behind. He’ll follow.
I’ll help you get ’em on their feet and moving.”</p>

<p>The men spread out at intervals to the north
of the herd, riding along its edge and crowding
the cows on the near fringe to their feet. They
worked cautiously, for any slight commotion of
an unusual nature, the weird flap of a garment
or any cry too startling, might serve to throw a
few cows into a panic which would be swiftly
communicated to the rest and put the whole herd
off the bed ground in a mad stampede. Their
chief concern was to prevent a disastrous night
run. The affair was skilfully handled and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
near fringe of cows rose reluctantly, crowded
back through the ranks of their reclining fellows
and raising them in turn till eventually the whole
herd was up and drifting south.</p>

<p>The moon rose sharp and clear as they crossed
into the Strip and for hours they forged slowly
ahead, their course a trifle south of west. When
they had covered ten miles the forward drift of
the herd was arrested and the tired cows bedded
down at once.</p>

<p>“From now on they’re in your hands, son,”
Hinman said to Carver. “I’ll back any deal you
make with the outfits off to the south, so play her
the best you know.”</p>

<p>He turned his horse back toward the State line
and left Carver to solve the problem as best he
might. Their present stand was in the quarantine
belt, a strip some miles wide which paralleled
the State line; this to protect the stock of the
Kansas cowmen from Texas fever and other contagious
afflictions so prevalent among the trail
herds brought up from the south. All southern
cattle must be held in this quarantine area until
declared free of all disease before proceeding on
their northward course to market. This was the
off-season for the pastoral transportation of trail
herds from the Texas cow country, and the only
official intervention against which Carver must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
guard was the possible appearance of one of the
infrequent cavalry patrols sent out from old Fort
Darlington on the southern extremity of the
Strip.</p>

<p>The unowned lands were tenanted only by a
few big cow outfits whose owners had made satisfactory
arrangements with the Cherokees, paying
their tribute in the shape of grazing fees, a custom
so long established that it was recognized by Federal
authorities, and government agents now collected
the money and passed it on to the territory
tribes.</p>

<p>Carver stood his turn on first guard and as he
rode round the herd he pondered the problem in
hand and sought for a solution which would give
him an insight into Hinman’s purpose. It was
not so much from the authorities but from the
common themselves that he might expect prompt
interference. Those who leased range in the
Strip did not often wait upon the slow process
of official intervention when outside brands encroached
upon their interests but took the law
into their own hands at once. Hinman was well
aware of that condition, Carver reflected. He
circled the herd and sang to soothe his charges on
the bed ground. Off across he could hear the
voice of another night guard raised in song. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
produced his one last coin and studied it in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>“Little lonely dollar, you must mount up to a
million,” he chanted. “And we’ll mount the first
step upward if only I can fathom what Hinman
expects of me. He don’t care a dime about saving
taxes on this bunch, and he knows that I can
see the costs will outweigh the profits two to one
even if everything goes through without a quiver.
He and Nate Younger, while they get along personal,
have been whetting their tomahawks for
each other as far back as I can remember. Now
he leads us down here due north of the center of
old Nate’s leases and stresses the point that I can
maybe trade deals with any outfit off to the south—and
Nate the only possible one I could deal
with from this point. What time I haven’t
worked for Hinman, I’ve been working for Nate,
and Old Joe knows that Nate’s the best friend
I’ve got outside himself. Now what’s he aiming
at?”</p>

<p>His shift on guard duty was half over before
he found the slightest ray of light on the problem.</p>

<p>“Joe must know that Nate will pounce down
on us right off,” he mused. “If they open the
Strip for settlement, like Joe predicts, then
Younger will be forced out of the game. Now
just why does Hinman provide him with this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
opportunity for a big final disturbance with all
the odds on Nate’s side? He couldn’t have done
it accidental and it appears more and more like
he’s deliberately throwing himself wide open.”</p>

<p>His mind traveled back over the events of the
day and settled upon the scene which had transpired
near the town well just prior to his departure.</p>

<p>“There now,” he suddenly remarked.
“That’s sure enough the answer. Bart and Mattison
didn’t want to carry that altercation to a
finish but neither one would back down with
folks looking on. These two stubborn old pirates
are likely in a similar frame of mind. It’s always
seemed to me someway, that they didn’t either
one feel half so hostile toward the other as they
made it appear. Joe’s giving Nate one final
chance to show his hand—to take a whack at
him or quit, hoping to cancel this old feud before
Nate’s crowded out. He didn’t send me down
here to keep out of trouble but shoved me right
into it, knowing I’d do my best to make it as
light as possible when it came. That’s all the
idea I’ve got to work on.”</p>

<p>The men breakfasted in the first light of day
and the cows were allowed to scatter through
the breaks on the far side of the creek.</p>

<p>“You boys hold ’em within fair limits,” Carver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
instructed Bradshaw. “I’ll join you up here
this evening. If a patrol should jump you by
any off chance, you just explain that you’re driving
them down to the Half Diamond H and laid
over here a day to rest them.”</p>

<p>“They’d be sure to believe us,” Bradshaw commented
skeptically. “Old Nate Younger
wouldn’t let a Kansas cow graze on the Half
Diamond H for the price of it. Leastways not
one of Hinman’s.”</p>

<p>“He’s maybe changed his mind,” said Carver.
“I’ll ride down and see.”</p>

<p>He headed for the home ranch of the Half Diamond
H, located on a branch of Cabin Creek
some miles above that stream’s confluence with
the Salt Fork of the Arkansas. Younger met
him halfway, a rider having already reported the
presence of the herd.</p>

<p>“Now just what are you doing with a bunch
of Joe Hinman’s cows in the quarantine strip and
messing along the edge of my range?” he demanded.
“You’ve rode for me on enough different
occasions to know better than that.”</p>

<p>“They just came fogging down here of their
own accord,” Carver testified. “And I came
after them.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see that you get plenty of help when it
comes to running them back,” Younger offered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
He waved an arm toward a group of approaching
riders. “Here come my boys now. I’ll throw
’em in behind those cows and jam them back
across the line and scatter ’em over the whole west
half of Kansas; or else take charge and hold ’em
till I can get a detachment sent up from Fort
Darlington to keep the whole mangy layout in
quarantine till they’re fined more’n their market
price. I’ll——”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t adopt either one of those courses
you just mentioned Nate,” Carver counselled.
“If a patrol jumped us I was going to proclaim
that Joe was short of range and that you, being
an old friend of his, had volunteered to run this
bunch on your leases till the grass greened up
next month. That was my idea.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got another idea that beats yours all to
hell,” Younger retorted. “About fifteen years
back a bunch of my stuff drifted off in a storm
and fed out a few sections of Joe Hinman’s land
that had blowed clear of snow. He thought I’d
shoved ’em on there to eat him out. This is the
first real good chance I’ve had to play even for
what shape he left those cows of mine in after
hazing ’em at a run through a foot of snow.
What I’ll do to this bunch of Box T steers will
be sufficient.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>He motioned his grinning riders to fall in behind
him as he headed up country with Carver.</p>

<p>“Then it does look as if I’d soon be out of a
job,” Carver said, “if you go and mess up my
detail. Maybe you’d take me on for the summer.”</p>

<p>“You was top hand for me once,” Younger
returned. “And you could be again if you’d
only stay at it. Anyway, I’ll put you on for the
summer.”</p>

<p>“This season will likely see the last big round-up
of all history,” Carver predicted. “And I
want to be part of it. I’d sort of planned to go
in with your wagon. I guess this is the last. The
order is out to comb every hoof from the unowned
lands.”</p>

<p>The old man’s face clouded. Two years before
all cowmen had been ordered to clear their stock
from the Cherokee Strip. They had grimly refused,
and now the order had been issued again.</p>

<p>“They mean business this time,” Carver predicted.
“There’ll be cavalry patrols riding to
keep an eye on the round-up, likely, and make
sure that everything’s gathered and shoved outside.
There’ll be upwards of two hundred thousand
cows collected and marketed this summer
in order to clear the Strip.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’re right, son,” Younger said.
“It’s beginning to look that way. You don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
want to miss the round-up. The likes of it will
never be seen again on this old footstool. All
wiped out in a single season. It ain’t right. It
just can’t be right.”</p>

<p>The old man’s thoughts strayed from the immediate
matter in hand, that of evening the old
score with Hinman, and he nodded abstractedly
to the comments of his younger companion. He
was possessed of cows in plenty and if forced to
market them he could cash in for a fortune; but
this game was his life. Take away his cows and
money would mean little.</p>

<p>“I was just thinking, Nate,” Carver said.
“It’ll take a long time to settle all this country
up after you folks are ordered out with your
stock, and there’ll be worlds of good range going
to waste with nothing to eat it off. A man could
hold a dodge-bunch down here on good feed and
keep ’em moving from point to point. If we
were questioned we could explain that we were
trail herding ’em through when they up and made
a night run off to one side; that we are just gathering
’em up again to move them on up to the
Box T range.”</p>

<p>“Box T!” Younger scoffed. “Joe Hinman,
that wrinkled old pirate, wouldn’t let a second
elapse before he’d be spreading the news that I
had a bunch down here. He’d never let a Half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
Diamond H cow set foot on his range and ever
get off with its hide on.”</p>

<p>“But if you’d help him out now, like I said a
while back, he’d be bound to return it out of sheer
human decency,” Carver pointed out. “I could
hold a bunch down here easy. If you help Joe
out now he can’t go back on you then.”</p>

<p>“Can’t be?” Nate inquired. “I don’t know.”
The blank wall of a cowless future loomed just
ahead. In a few more months his old brand
would be but a tradition. The only alternative
would be to buy out another brand in some distant
part where open range was still available.
But this was his chosen territory and a move did
not appeal. “One time and another I’ve dealt
him a hell-slew of trouble.”</p>

<p>“He’s put in fifteen years handing it back to
you,” Carver said. “That’s part of the game, the
way the pair of you has played it. Joe’s not the
man to stick at trifles like that.”</p>

<p>Younger shook his head.</p>

<p>“Then maybe he was mistaken about how you
felt,” said Carver. “He gave me my instructions
straight enough. ‘If you strike trouble
down there just go right to the Half Diamond H
and get in touch with Nate Younger,’ he says.
‘He’ll put you straight, and if he can’t fix you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
up then there’s no way out.’ That’s the last
words he told me.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t,” Nate returned doubtfully.
“You got mixed in the names. He didn’t ever
instruct you to look to me for anything but
trouble.”</p>

<p>“Those were my orders,” Carver affirmed.
“Word for word, as near as I can recall, just as
I recited them to you. That’s what he says, looking
right at me, just what I told you he did.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what he’s driving at,” Younger
stated. “But I’ll certainly hand him a surprise.
I’ll take him up—which’ll be exactly the last
thing he’d counted on.”</p>

<p>He tugged his hat over his eyes and turned to
the nearest of the riders who trailed behind him.</p>

<p>“You boys dangle along back and take down
the north fence for a few hundred yards west of
the creek,” he instructed. “Pull the staples and
lay the wire flat on the ground so Carver can
cross in with his bunch any time.”</p>

<p>The men gazed in blank astonishment at thus
being deprived of their contemplated sport but
they turned back without comment.</p>

<p>“That Carver now,” one youth remarked.
“He’s the silver-tongued little fixer. He’s somehow
managed to reverse old Nate in mid-air.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
Once in Caldwell he talked me out of my last
dollar. He did, honest.”</p>

<p>“But he spent it on you later,” another testified.
“That’s him. But now he’s gone and
ruined my whole day. I’d prefer to be jamming
them cows north at a run to coaxing staples out
of fence posts.”</p>

<p>Some days thereafter Freel rode northward
through the leases of the Half Diamond H,
crossed the Salt Fork and stayed overnight at the
home ranch of that brand. For several days the
marshal had been visiting the widely scattered
outfits operating in that portion of the Strip and
making inquiries as to the whereabouts of certain
men on a day of the preceding week. Freel knew
the customs of the men with whom he had to deal,
being familiar with the evasiveness which was a
country-wide characteristic whenever one citizen
was questioned concerning the possible operations
of another. The marshal’s queries were therefore
more or less desultory and wholly unproductive.</p>

<p>On the date in question four masked horsemen
had surrounded a box car recently planted beside
the railroad track in the Cherokee Strip. This
car had served as a station and the word “Casa”
had been painted in white letters upon either end.
The stockmen had stubbornly resisted all attempts
to establish stations in the unowned lands,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
foreseeing in such moves another possible link
toward the dreaded settling of the Strip. These
wild riders had evicted the two men stationed
there and applied the torch to the box car which
seemed to presage a future settlement at that
point. The embryo city of Casa was no more.
Freel was conscious of no particular regret over
the fate of this defunct metropolis, but in view
of the fact that only Federal officers were vested
with authority in the Cherokee lands he felt it
expedient to make a few perfunctory inquiries.</p>

<p>When he rode away from the Half Diamond
H he elected to wend his way up Cabin Creek
and so chanced across two thousand head of Joe
Hinman’s cows grazing in the quarantine strip.
Freel sought out Carver and acquainted him with
the details of the Casa raid.</p>

<p>“The Lassiters rode out of Caldwell Tuesday
night, you recollect,” he said. “They’re a shifty
bunch of boys, the Lassiters. But Crowfoot assures
me that they turned up at his place on Turkey
Creek early Wednesday morning and this
Casa raid was Wednesday night. Crowfoot
says they’ve been there straight through. That
lets the Lassiters out.”</p>

<p>Carver recalled the black scrap of cloth he had
seen in the dresser drawer in the Lassiter’s room,
its eyeholes staring up at him. Crowfoot’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
testimony to the marshal did not cause Carver to
revise his former estimate of the cowman; rather
it served to strengthen his previous opinion as to
Crowfoot’s character.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “Yes, that lets the Lassiters
out.”</p>

<p>“But it don’t have any particular bearing on
the fact that Hinman’s cows are grazing in the
quarantine strip,” the marshal commented.</p>

<p>“Joe’s short of range,” Carver returned. This
was according to formula. “We’re resting ’em
over here for a day before taking ’em on down
to the Half Diamond H.”</p>

<p>“That’s nice,” said Freel. “But of course it’s
my duty as an officer to report their presence to
the Federal authorities. Then they can use their
own judgment as to quarantine proceedings and
maybe even a trespass suit. Tax-dodging, is
he?”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet fifty even that you go and do that
very thing,” Carver stated.</p>

<p>“How do you know?” the marshal retorted.
“I’ll bet you a hundred I don’t.”</p>

<p>“A hundred is way beyond my depth,” said
Carver. “Even fifty would strain me most to
pieces, but I could manage to pay it the day I
land in Caldwell if I lost.”</p>

<p>“Fifty’s a bet,” the marshal accepted. “I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
take you on. And don’t forget to have the money
in your clothes next time you show up in Caldwell.”</p>

<p>Carver gazed after Freel’s retreating back as
the worthy marshal rode northward toward the
line.</p>

<p>“There goes a part of my profits,” he observed.
“This petty larceny milking process enlightens
me as to why I never could warm up to Freel.
I’d rather he’d held me up, but the man that’ll do
one won’t do the other—not ever. It all comes
of my being too honest. If I’d neglected to make
that losing bet, he’d have made a report that
might have caused old Joe some grief. My conscience
has let me down for fifty. Honesty is
maybe the best policy for the long pull but it’s
ruinous in short spurts.”</p>

<p>Someway he regretted the loss of that fifty
dollars, a sentiment hitherto unknown to him,
for he had never valued dollars except as a means
to an end and the end was in each case the same,—the
swift squandering of the means. But of
late, while riding his lonely way in charge of
Hinman’s cows, he had pondered the possibilities
of various projects in which he might engage, the
accumulation of dollars, not their spending, constituting
the ultimate objective in each case.</p>

<p>When the marshal had disappeared Carver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
rode a few miles north to the crest of a high ridge,
from which point of vantage he could sweep a
considerable area. Off across the State line he
could make out white points of light at intervals
of a mile or more, and he knew them for the
covered wagons of squatters who were camped
just outside the Strip. He knew too that as one
neared Caldwell he would find the intervals between
these camps considerably decreased and he
made a tentative estimate that there were fifty
such outfits camped along the line in the twenty
miles between himself and Caldwell. For three
months these homeless ones had been rolling up
to the edge of the unowned lands and making
camp. These were but the vanguard, the first
to respond to the persistent rumor recently set
afloat to the effect that the Strip would soon be
thrown open for entry and free homes be made
available for all.</p>

<p>Carver allowed his mental vision to travel far
beyond the horizon which cut off his physical
view, and he saw other wagons coming. He pictured
them scattered along the roads of Kansas,
Nebraska and Missouri, of Illinois and Iowa.
From far and near the landless of a vast country
were converging upon this last corner left unsettled,
their worldly effects crowded into the
bulging beds of old-time prairie schooners, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
live stock trailing behind and the tousled heads
of their youngsters peering curiously from the
wagons as they rolled through country strange to
them. Their pace was slow and plodding but
intensely purposeful, a miniature reproduction of
that general movement which had resulted in reclaiming
the Great West from savagery a few
decades before,—a movement which Carver felt
could not long be forestalled. He addressed his
luck piece in prophetic vein.</p>

<p>“It’s coming and we can’t head it off. In ten
years there’ll be a squatter on every second section
and the old free range cut up with fence.
Little lonely dollar, what will you and me be doing
then? That’s the prospect that’s looming
just ahead of us.”</p>

<p>In fact this prospect seemed nearer still when
he crossed back with Hinman’s cows some weeks
thereafter. With the first warm days of approaching
spring the slow stream of incoming
squatters had increased and there were more outfits
camped along the line. Carver rode up to
the ranch house in the gray light of dawn to
report that the herd was back on Hinman’s own
range once more. He found old Joe at breakfast
and was invited to sit in.</p>

<p>“Draw up your stool and toss a feed in you,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
the old man greeted. “Tell me how everything
came to pass.”</p>

<p>“It was a right uneventful trip,” Carver reported.
“There was only one patrol came messing
through and we shifted the bunch down on to
the Half Diamond H for a week or more.”</p>

<p>“The Half Diamond H!” Hinman exclaimed.
“Then Nate Younger must have died without
me getting word of it. I’ll send over some flowers
right away. It’s a moral certainty that roan-whiskered
old lizard wouldn’t let one of my cows
have a spoonful of grass if he was alive and kicking.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” said Carver; “he put
himself out to invite us down in case we thought
best to pull off the quarantine belt. He ordered
his north fence laid flat as soon as he gets word
we’re in the country with your cows, and announced
that he’d be palsied and paralyzed and
even worse than that before he’d be found lacking
in hospitality toward a friend in need.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hinman. “Go right on. What
else did he say?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to speak of,” Carver said. “He did
sort of mention that you was welcome to throw
as much stuff as you liked on the Half Diamond
H as long as he was running it. So you might
say the trip was more or less of a holiday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>Hinman allowed his gaze to rove through the
window and settle upon a covered wagon crawling
slowly southward.</p>

<p>“He’ll be crowded clear off the map inside
another year,” Hinman said. “I don’t suppose
you told him about how glad I’d be to have him
swarm over here on my grass with all his cows
whenever he’s finally ordered out down there;
now did you?”</p>

<p>“I did sort of intimate that your range would
always be wide open,” Carver stated. “I was
straining every little point to save the taxes on
that bunch of cows. I’ll bet it would have totalled
up to anyhow six hundred dollars, those taxes
would.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all you agreed to do,” said Hinman.
“And I guess I’d better pay you off and
have it over with, even if you did get me into
considerable of a snarl. Only one thing I can do
now, since you made all those arrangements, and
that’s to back up anything you told Nate. I
never figured you’d let me in for anything like
this.”</p>

<p>“I’d prefer to take my pay in some other form
than cash,” Carver announced as Hinman produced
his check book. “Suppose you give me a
bill of sale for a hundred head of coming yearlings
instead of nine hundred cash and let ’em<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
range with your stuff up on the west place till
November.”</p>

<p>“You can’t spend calves,” said Hinman.</p>

<p>“I could borrow against them if I was needing
money,” Carver explained.</p>

<p>“But coming yearlings are worth twelve dollars
a head,” Hinman objected.</p>

<p>“I’ll owe you the rest,” Carver offered.</p>

<p>“And when I deliver in November they’ll be
worth more’n that. They’ll bring round sixteen
dollars a head by then.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I was counting on,” said Carver.
“I like to feel every morning that I’m worth just
a little more than I was the night before.”</p>

<p>Hinman laid down the check book and regarded
him.</p>

<p>“Now it’s always struck me that you put yourself
out to be worth just a mite less each morning
than you was the night before,” he stated.
“Surely you haven’t gone and deserted the ranks
of the tumbleweeds in favor of the pumpkins. I
never knew you to set a value on a dollar.”</p>

<p>“That’s because I never chanced across just
the right sort of dollar,” Carver explained.
“Now this is different.” He produced his lucky
coin and handed it over for inspection. “I’m
aiming to accumulate a number of others just like
this to keep it company.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Hinman inspected the silver dollar.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “This is a right unusual appearing
sort of coin. Don’t know as I ever see
one just like it. Now if you really think there’s
a chance for you to collect some more like this
and take an interest in holding on to them, why
we might make a deal. You’ve just effected
quite a saving on my taxes, so I can maybe
stretch a point. But if I don’t deliver till November,
and run ’em meantime on my grass, those
critters will cost you fourteen apiece instead of
twelve. You’ll be owing me five hundred in place
of three.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind owing you,” said Carver.
“We’ll close the deal.”</p>

<p>As he rode away from the Box T he sang:</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> crest of the watershed separating the flow
between the Salt Fork and the Cimarron was also
the dividing line between Crowfoot’s range and
the leases of the Half Diamond H. Carver
crossed over this low divide and angled toward
Turkey Creek to intersect its course at a point
near Crowfoot’s place. Here the majority of the
range stock wore the straggling brand intended
to represent a bird’s claw, the badge of Crowfoot’s
ownership.</p>

<p>Carver viewed the ranch buildings from the
shoulder of a hill, noting particularly the corral
which was fashioned as a solid stockade some ten
feet high. Crowfoot had entered into a beef contract
with the railroad and his slaughtering was
conducted within this small enclosure. Carver
entertained positive convictions as to the purpose
of this arrangement but in common with others
of his kind he made a religion of remaining
strictly incurious regarding the calling or customs
of acquaintances except in so far as they might
affect his own immediate affairs.</p>

<p>He turned his horse up the Turkey Creek bottoms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
and followed that stream for a dozen miles,
then angled away to the right toward the Half
Diamond H range. When well up the gentle
slope he rode out on to the rim of a pocket. The
scattering trees in the bottoms indicated the
presence of water. A spring branch probably
headed in the pocket and drained back toward
Turkey Creek, he reflected. He pulled up his
horse as a woman’s voice floated up to him.
Somewhere down below him a girl was singing,
and Carver headed his horse down the slope
toward the sound.</p>

<p>A sod house nestled under the hill beside the
trickling spring-creek. The singing ceased
abruptly and a girl appeared in the door of the
sod house at the sound of his horse’s hoofs in the
yard.</p>

<p>For the second time Carver saw her framed in
a doorway and he was conscious of a sudden
pleased conviction that she should always choose
a similar setting. The drab surroundings served
only as a background to hold her vivid youth and
charm in more startling relief. Carver recollected
that he had mauled one brother in no gentle
fashion and was held accountable for another’s
day of transgressions; in consequence he feared
a cool reception from the sister. Instead, her
face lighted with sudden recognition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>“Oh, it’s you!” she greeted. “Bart will be
coming home any time now and he’d be so sorry
if he missed you. Won’t you step down off your
horse and wait?”</p>

<p>She sat on the doorsill and motioned Carver to
a seat on a bench against the cabin. He removed
his hat and tilted back against the sod wall as she
explained that Bart was even now overdue. As
they talked it was quite evident that all her
thoughts centered round the younger brother.
Carver found the tones of her voice as pleasant to
his ear as the sight of her was pleasing to his
eyes, and he was content to listen, hoping meanwhile
that Bart would never come.</p>

<p>He knew this for a Crowfoot line camp, recently
installed, which accounted for the fact that
he had not chanced across it the year before. The
Lassiters, therefore, must ride for Crowfoot, he
decided.</p>

<p>“Bart and I only came down last week,” she
said. “We’ve been living in your little house in
Caldwell. Did you know?”</p>

<p>“I gave him the key and told him the place
was his,” Carver said. “But I’d have straightened
it up a bit if I’d known he was going to
install you there.”</p>

<p>“It was supremely tidy,” she complimented.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
“Which was a distinct surprise. Most men’s
housekeeping is rather the reverse.”</p>

<p>Her gaze kept wandering off down the bottoms
for some sign of Bart’s return.</p>

<p>“I do hope he comes,” she said.</p>

<p>“I’m real anxious to see Bart,” he confessed.
“I certainly hope he turns up sometime inside
of the next three or four hours for this is my busy
day and I couldn’t conscientiously wait on him
longer than that.”</p>

<p>His tones expressed only a mild anxiety over
the possible non-arrival of his friend.</p>

<p>“Do please stay the very limit, at least,” she
urged, and laughed up at him. “You know,
you’re like Bart in a great many ways.” Carver
someway felt that he knew her better after that
laugh. “Don’t you think you two are somewhat
alike?”</p>

<p>He had divined the close bond between this
girl and her brother and now made swift use of
the knowledge.</p>

<p>“Bart and I are so similar that we might easy
be mistaken for twins,” he admitted. “You
might say we’re almost identical.”</p>

<p>“He means a lot to me Bart does,” she
said. “In most ways he’s a lovable youngster,
but——”</p>

<p>Carver leaned back with an audible sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“Tell me all about Bart,” he urged.</p>

<p>“I will,” she agreed. “In most ways he’s
likable but he’s as wild as a hawk. He is absolutely
irresponsible and will commit any reckless
folly on a second’s notice without a thought of
future consequences. The future means not one
thing to him. He’s sublimely confident that
every new day stands by itself, entirely unrelated
to either yesterday or to-morrow. And he’s too
easily led. Now don’t you think you two are
considerably alike?”</p>

<p>Carver considered this at some length.</p>

<p>“There’s some few particulars wherein our
make-ups branch way out apart,” he testified.
“On those points we’re altogether dissimilar.
Now me, I just can’t be led. I’m sometimes
misled, maybe, but never plain led. And so far
as the relation of one day to another”—he produced
a silver dollar and regarded it—“why
nothing could possibly convince me that five
weeks ago last Tuesday wasn’t close kin to to-day.”
The girl’s mind flashed back to that first
meeting as he smiled across at her and continued:
“And I’m hoping that there’ll be other days in
the future that’ll belong to the same family
group. You’d be downright surprised to know
how far my mind wanders into the future—and
you accusing me of not looking ahead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“He’s told me a lot about you,” she said.
“You’re the supreme chief of the tumbleweeds,
from what I gather; openly irresponsible.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary, I’m apt to take my responsibilities
too much to heart if I don’t watch myself,”
he defended. “Do you consider a state of
responsibility one to strive for?” Then, as she
nodded, “Hereafter I’ll track down responsibilities
like a duck collects Junebugs, and assume
one after the next.”</p>

<p>“I’ve raised Bart from a baby,” she said.
“And I don’t want to see him go over to the wild
bunch. He likes you a lot. Use that influence to
steady him, won’t you, instead of the other
way?”</p>

<p>“Just what is the main thing you want Bart
to stay clear of?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I want him to run straight,” she said.</p>

<p>Carver rose to take his leave, his departure
hastened by the sight of a horseman through the
trees far down the bottoms. And the rider was
not Bart. He had no desire to meet Noll Lassiter
during his first real visit with the girl, and
he somehow knew the identity of the man who
approached.</p>

<p>“Maybe I can do Bart a trifle of good in
spots,” he said, as he stood before her. “And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
I’ll guarantee not to do him any great amount
of harm.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” she said, rising to face him and extending
her hand. “I knew you’d do it.”</p>

<p>Carver retained the hand and leaned to kiss her
as she stood looking up at him. The girl stepped
back and studied him, evidencing no annoyance
but seeming rather to try to determine the
thought which had occasioned the act and searching
for a possible trace of disrespect. Carver
met her eyes fairly.</p>

<p>“You oughtn’t to have smiled just at that particular
moment,” he said.</p>

<p>“You see, you are irresponsible,” she pointed
out. “That’s exactly what Bart would have
done. You yield to any passing whim.”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t any passing whim,” he corrected.
“It was one powerful impulse; and it’s
permanent—not passing. It’s related to to-day
and five weeks ago Tuesday, and I’m hoping it’s
related to to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She disregarded this except for an almost imperceptible
shake of her head.</p>

<p>“But you will remember about Bart,” she
urged.</p>

<p>“I’ll try and collect all Bart’s loose ends and
shape him up into one solid pattern of propriety,”
he promised. “You won’t hardly know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
him for the same party after I’ve worked him
over.” He swung to the saddle. “But I’ll have
to put in considerable time over here conferring
with you if we’re going to make a success out of
Bart.”</p>

<p>He turned his horse to leave but the approaching
rider had hastened through the last belt of
trees and he now held up a hand and signalled
Carver to wait. Lassiter pulled up his horse
abruptly as he discovered Carver’s identity.</p>

<p>“I thought it was Wellman,” he stated surlily.
“Who asked you here? This is a little off your
range.”</p>

<p>“I travel on a roving permit,” Carver said.
He explored his pockets as if seeking the document
and an expression of mock concern overspread
his face. “I declare, I must have mislaid
it somehow. But I believe I showed it to you
once before; and anyway, I’m going now.”</p>

<p>He nodded a casual good-by to the girl, turned
his back on Lassiter and departed. As he
mounted the cow trail leading out of the head of
the pocket he met Bart Lassiter coming down.</p>

<p>“I’ve just been over to your house visiting
round with Miss Molly,” Carver greeted. “Noll
came riding up and I someway gathered the impression
that he wasn’t glad to see me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>The two lolled sidewise in their saddles. Bart
looked down the bottoms toward the sod house.</p>

<p>“I’d keep an eye peeled for Noll,” he advised.
“He’s out for you if he sees the right chance. If
you don’t watch sharp your horse will come
dangling in some day without a rider.”</p>

<p>“Sho!” Carver deprecated. “It’s been against
the law to kill folks for a long time now.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Bart. “But the mere fact
that we’ve got a law like that proves that maybe
some one did get killed once and there’s a chance
it might happen again.”</p>

<p>“He’s been telling you things,” Carver
guessed. “Likely he was just easing his mind.”</p>

<p>“Noll didn’t tell me a word,” Bart denied.
“He don’t need to. I know him. He rode hard
on me with a club, up until I outgrew him, and I
can read what’s going on in his mind. I put in
all my early years dodging, until one day he
cuffed Molly; then I forgot my timidity and
pulled down his meat house. It was weeks before
he was up and around. He’ll bear watching.
I don’t mean to infer that Noll’s all charged
with valor, which he’s not, but he’s certainly
loaded to the ears with meanness and he’ll take
a chance if the odds are all his way and no one
looking on.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll take to surveying my back track,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Carver promised. “Because if we meet it will
likely be from the rear.”</p>

<p>“That’s where,” Bart agreed.</p>

<p>“What’s to hinder my taking you on as a
bodyguard, sort of?” Carver suggested. “I’m
going in with the Half Diamond H wagon. Old
Nate would put you on.”</p>

<p>“The three of us are leaving for the X I L in
a day or two,” said Bart. “Otherwise I’d go with
you. Milt has been trail boss for the X I L for
the last four summers and brought their trail
herds through. Always before we’ve gone on
back and wintered there, but this season we laid
over to help Crowfoot.”</p>

<p>Carver turned this arrangement over in his
mind. The X I L was a Texas brand running
south of the Washita country.</p>

<p>“I’ll have a little deal on this fall after round-up,”
he said. “And I’d like to have you cut in
with me, provided you don’t hang out at Crowfoot’s.
I’m not over-squeamish and there’s one
time and another when I’ve rode for outfits
whose methods was open to question. Most riders
have. But folks are coming to frown on irregularities
and it’s time a man reads his signs
right and quits before it’s just too late.”</p>

<p>“Oh, absolutely,” Bart agreed easily. “I can
see that plain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“It’s my surmise that there’s a right small percentage
of the meat that goes to fill Crowfoot’s
contracts with the railroad that is dressed out of
steers wearing his own brand,” Carver said. “Of
course, he’s too smart to cut in on his neighbors,
and they don’t bother to get curious as long as
they know their own strays are safe on his range.
But it’s my guess that if a steer from some foreign
outfit turns up on the Turkey Creek range
he’ll get converted into beef overnight.”</p>

<p>Lassiter grinned and wagged a negative head.</p>

<p>“Now you wouldn’t go and suspect Crowfoot
of filling his beef contracts at other folks’ expense,”
he reproved. “Besides, how could he
when it’s the law that whenever a cow critter is
butchered its hide must be hung on the fence till
it’s been inspected and passed?”</p>

<p>“And our present hide inspector would ride
miles out of his way rather than meet a fresh hide
face to face,” Carver testified. “I expect maybe
Crowfoot kills out a batch of his own steers, about
every third slaughtering. That way there’d always
be enough fresh hides of his own brand
hanging round the place to make it look right.
But he wouldn’t dress out any more of his own
till after one batch of pelts was too dried out to
answer. He’s not that improvident.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe not,” Bart said. “I couldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
say for sure. What has Crowfoot done to you
to start you commenting on his habits?”</p>

<p>“Not anything!” Carver confessed. “I don’t
even lose sleep over what he’s doing to other
folks. I’m generalizing, kind of. Things are
changing rapid and a man had better let his
glance rove a few years ahead.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t he, though?” Bart concurred. He
didn’t inquire as to the nature of Carver’s proposition,
for it mattered not at all. “We’ll put on
our telescopes and spy out a soft berth for the
future. That’s us. You can count me in till the
hair slips.”</p>

<p>With this casual promise they separated.
Carver reviewed his recent utterances with some
doubt as he rode across the divide.</p>

<p>“That’s the first time I ever aspired to turn
evangelist,” he said. “And I’m awkward at it.
The rôle don’t become me any to speak of, but
I’ve committed myself to take Bart in hand.”</p>

<p>Three days later he rode again to the little sod
house on the spring-creek. He came upon it
from behind, his horse’s hoofs making but slight
sound on the springy turf. Not until he had dismounted
and rounded the corner on foot did he
discover that a saddled horse stood on the far side
of the house. He stopped short, wondering
which of the three brothers might be at home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
While he hesitated a man’s voice sounded from
within, and it was not that of any one of the
Lassiters. He took another step toward the
door but halted again as he detected a threat in
the tones of the man inside.</p>

<p>“You listen to reason or I’ll have Bart locked
up for the rest of his natural life,” the voice proclaimed.
“And that within the next two days.
I know his whereabouts on a certain night two
years ago, when a saloon in Taosin was ransacked.”</p>

<p>“You’ve told me all that,” said the girl. “But
even if you could prove it, why Bart was only
seventeen then.”</p>

<p>“There’s places where they keep such naughty
children,” the man pointed out. “Then he was
into that Casa affair, when the station was
burned.”</p>

<p>This statement enabled Carver to identify the
man whose voice had seemed vaguely familiar.
It could be no other than Freel.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a line on the whole past of the Lassiters,”
Freel resumed. “Clear back prior to
when the old man was alive. He’d be wanted
too, on a dozen counts, if he was still above
ground. You know what it is to have the law
always barking at your door. If you take up
with me folks would respect you. But any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
in this whole country will tell you that Freel is a
bad man to have on the other side. You don’t
want me lined up against the Lassiters, girl.”</p>

<p>Carver stepped to the door. Freel’s back was
toward him but he could see the girl’s face.
There was no trace of apprehension there, only
distaste for the man before her. Her eyes widened
with surprise as they met Carver’s and as
she divined his purpose she made a move to station
herself between the two men but Carver held
up a hand to halt her. Freel had whirled to
face the door when the girl’s face betrayed the
presence of a third party. He recovered his
self-confidence, shaken for the moment, with the
discovery of the intruder’s identity.</p>

<p>“Morning,” he greeted casually. “Any more
wagers on your mind to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Carver. “Step outside. I’m
going to make you another little bet.”</p>

<p>He stepped aside as the marshal passed
through the door, then followed and closed it
behind him.</p>

<p>“This wager’s not going to be in money,”
Carver said. “If I lose I’ll look you up and
explain to you what the stakes are. I’m betting
that you don’t ever pass out any remarks about
Bart Lassiter or his sister. The bridle’s off as far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
as the other two boys are concerned. You can
go as far as you like with them.”</p>

<p>Freel sized him up, sensing a new quality in
the man before him, a certain tenseness which
Carver concealed beneath the cloak of casual
speech.</p>

<p>“You drop out of this,” he advised. “I was
offering to marry Miss Lassiter when you
romped in.”</p>

<p>“Offering to,” said Carver. “I thought maybe
you was threatening to.”</p>

<p>“Any girl of the Lassiter tribe ought to be
damn glad of an opportunity to marry and
live respectable,” Freel stated, and was instantly
aware that he had made a grave mistake, for
that quality which he had sensed in Carver was
now quite openly apparent in his eyes.</p>

<p>“So you’re going to make her respectable,”
Carver said. “That’s real generous of you, I’d
say. It’s rumored around that you set up to be
a bad one. I just heard you confess it. Let’s
see how wicked you can be when your badness
all boils over.”</p>

<p>He took a step toward Freel and the marshal
backed away, reading Carver’s purpose in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s never my policy to start a quarrel without
good reason,” he announced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“I’m laying myself out to supply the reason,”
Carver said. “I always did want to see a
regular desperado working at his trade.” He
removed his hat with his left hand and brought
it with a back-handed slash across the marshal’s
face. “You’re wicked clear through,” he said.
“You’re just as bad as you can be.”</p>

<p>He swung the hat twice again but Freel
turned and walked toward his horse.</p>

<p>“You’re not bad; you’re just tainted,” Carver
stated. “I always felt that about you and now
I know for sure.”</p>

<p>The marshal mounted and turned upon Carver
a face set in lines of stern disapproval.</p>

<p>“I refuse to force an issue except in the
regular routine of duty,” he proclaimed. “This
is not a matter of official business. Otherwise——”</p>

<p>He intended that the unfinished statement
should carry an impressive implication of power
held in reserve and which he controlled only
with the greatest difficulty. He turned and rode
off down the bottoms.</p>

<p>“I feel like I’d just come in off a spree,”
Carver told himself. “It shakes a man up something
fearful to let his temper go running wild
all over the lot. I oughtn’t to have lost hold of
myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>He regarded the closed door. A sharp rap
sounded from the inside of it and Carver smiled
as he speculated as to how many people of his
acquaintance would have respected his unspoken
wish that the door remain closed. The rap
sounded again.</p>

<p>“Come in,” he called.</p>

<p>She opened the door and answered his smile,
her eyes following the marshal as he disappeared
in the scattering black-jacks of the bottoms.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” she said. “I’m glad you came
just when you did. But I’m sorry if you made
an enemy of him. I really don’t mind him—much.”</p>

<p>“He’s right harmless,” said Carver. “But
apt to be annoying. I don’t surmise he’ll be
turning up here again.”</p>

<p>He knew that the marshal operated only on
safe ground. Freel had known that both elder
brothers would be entirely indifferent to any
course he might adopt toward Molly Lassiter if
only it afforded a measure of protection for
themselves; and she would not mention any such
occurrence to Bart lest it precipitate trouble
between himself and Freel.</p>

<p>The girl motioned him to a seat on the bench.</p>

<p>“You did remember your promise of the other
day,” she commended. “About Bart, I mean.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
He said you’d pointed out the narrow pathway
and invited him to join forces.”</p>

<p>“I never did set up as a reformer,” Carver
admitted, “and it likely sounded a mite unnatural,
coming from me.”</p>

<p>“Bart was a little vague about the plans,” she
said. “Do you mind telling me what the proposition
was?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say any offhand,” he confessed.
“You see I just put it up to him and was intending
to work out the details later on. There,
now!” he complained, as she laughed at this lack
of definiteness. “You’re doubting my stability
again. There’s numerous ways open for me to
follow.” He checked them off on his fingers. “I
might get appointed marshal in Freel’s place and
there’s any number of folks would contribute to
my success. I could assist Crowfoot to fill his
beef contracts; or I could get the job of hide
inspector and Crowfoot would then assist me.”</p>

<p>Beneath this facetious recitation of possibilities
she read in his reference to Crowfoot a deliberate
intention to apprise her of the fact that the man’s
methods were open to question, leaving her to
devise her own means of utilizing the knowledge
in so far as it related to Bart’s employment by
Crowfoot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>“The boys are all leaving for the X I L in a
few days now,” she returned.</p>

<p>“This man Bronson that owns the X I L—he’s
someway related to Crowfoot,” said Carver.
“Seems like I’ve heard he was. Anyway, there’s
some connection. I spoke for a job for Bart with
the Half Diamond H wagon and was hoping he’d
take it on.”</p>

<p>When Carver rose to leave he rested his hands
on her shoulders as she stood facing him.</p>

<p>“The round-up will cut into our conferences
but I’m looking forward to resuming them after
it’s over.”</p>

<p>She stepped back and shook her head as he
leaned toward her.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget how much I’m like Bart,” he
urged. “And you know you’d do that much for
him. You might try it on me once, just for similarity’s
sake.”</p>

<p>The girl faced him gravely.</p>

<p>“I’m going to absolve you from that promise,”
she said. “Try and forget all about the Lassiters.
We bring bad luck.”</p>

<p>“It’s too late to start forgetting; and besides,
I cut my first baby teeth on a horseshoe,” he returned;
“and from that day on down to date I’ve
been the greatest sort of a hand to counteract bad
luck. It positively refuses to settle in my neighborhood.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
I’ll tell you all about it, Honey, as soon
as the round-up’s over.”</p>

<p>She stood and watched him ride off up the
country, returning his salutation when he turned
in his saddle and waved to her as he reached the
rim of the pocket.</p>

<p>He spent the night at a line camp and the next
day made a long ride into Caldwell, dismounting
before his little cabin in the early evening. A
blanketed figure prowled uneasily at the far side
of the street as Carver unsaddled, then crossed
over and padded silently along the path that led
to the house.</p>

<p>“Me like whiskey,” the Indian stated.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Carver. “So do I. But they do
say it’s a sinful appetite.”</p>

<p>The red man pondered this.</p>

<p>“Me buy whiskey,” he amended, exhibiting a
gold piece.</p>

<p>“I’m just out,” said Carver. “Try next
door.”</p>

<p>The Indian departed, only to be replaced some
few minutes later by a second applicant. Carver
recalled the incident of the two black bottles on
that other day when he had first met Bart Lassiter
in the Silver Dollar.</p>

<p>“Bart has been up to some more financing,” he
reflected. “While Molly was downtown somewhere,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
he was busy irrigating the Cherokee
nation at a profit. I’ve heard somewheres that
if you do any one thing better than your neighbors
the world will beat a pathway to your door—and
this path looks well-worn and much-traveled.
I’ll have to speak to Bart about this.”</p>

<p>He retired for the night after a third thirsty
soul had made the pilgrimage down the pathway
to the door.</p>

<p>“Before I can straighten out Molly’s affairs,”
he said, “it does look as if I’d have to discharge
a marshal, reform one brother and practice homicide
on another.”</p>

<p>With this disquieting reflection he dropped instantly
asleep. An hour later his awakening was
equally abrupt. It is given only to those who live
much in the open to wake suddenly from profound
slumber with every faculty alert. When
Carver opened his eyes he was conscious that
something was amiss. He continued his regular
deep breathing as if still wrapped in sleep. His
horse fidgeted nervously in the lean-to shed behind;
but he knew that this sound, being one to
which he was accustomed, would not have roused
him. The spring lock on the door had clicked
slightly as if under the manipulation of a stealthy
hand and the sound had penetrated his consciousness
even while he slept. Probably another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
parched but hopeful Cherokee, he reflected, but
he rose noiselessly and stepped to the window.</p>

<p>“I didn’t start discharging and homiciding
soon enough,” he told himself.</p>

<p>Freel and Noll Lassiter stood outside in the
bright moonlight, the latter having just stepped
back within Carver’s range of vision after testing
the spring lock on the door. Carver turned
swiftly and donned shirt and trousers. The latch
clicked again as he pulled on his chaps; then
came a sharp knock at the door. Carver did not
answer but finished buckling his belt and drew on
one boot. The rap was repeated.</p>

<p>“Ho!” Carver called loudly, as if suddenly
roused from heavy sleep. “What’s going on?”</p>

<p>“It’s Freel,” the deputy’s voice answered.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Carver. “Come on in. I’m in
bed.”</p>

<p>“Door’s locked,” Freel returned.</p>

<p>“Must have blown shut,” Carver stated.
“There’s a spring lock on it. Wait a minute and
I’ll pile into some clothes and let you in. What
do you want, anyway, at this time of night?”</p>

<p>“There’s been complaints lodged against you
for selling whiskey to the Cherokees,” Freel explained
apologetically. “I don’t suppose there’s
anything to it but I was ordered to make the
arrest. You can clear yourself likely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>Carver laughed easily.</p>

<p>“Why, man! This is the first time I’ve been
here in two months,” he scoffed. “They won’t
keep me overnight.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” said Freel. “It’s the pen if
they cinch you—Federal law, you know. I
didn’t like the idea of coming after you but I was
ordered to do it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be with you in a minute,” Carver answered
cheerfully. “I can explain it easy
enough.”</p>

<p>He thumped the bed with the edge of his hand
in imitation of a bare foot descending upon the
floor.</p>

<p>“Killed while resisting arrest,” he said to himself,
his mind working swiftly. “This is just a
plain old-fashioned killing. Freel knows I
wouldn’t be so simple as to start shooting over
being picked up on a fool charge like this. I’d
take it more as a joke. He’ll step in to talk it
over while Noll pots me from outside. Neighbors
hear shots—a regular battle in progress—and
later, at the inquest, it transpires that my
gun’s been shot empty. They can prove that
Cherokees have been buying bottles here, whether
I did it or not, and Freel, having heard about it,
had come out to investigate. I put up a desperate
fight but went down in the smoke—died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
hard as it were, but real dead. But they wouldn’t
do it before I was dressed. That might appear
like they’d slaughtered me in my sleep.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile he commented in disjointed fragments
to Freel.</p>

<p>“I’ll go on down with you and explain it. It’s
a right foolish charge.” He was now fully
dressed. “They’ll let me out by to-morrow so it
don’t matter any.” And to himself, “After
Noll’s first shot there’s two from inside. Neighbors
look out into the moonlight. Freel has
ducked back outside and they see him prone on
the ground shooting into the house. He rushes
the open door, calling out to me to surrender in
the name of the law, and the neighbors all hear
him. There’s sounds of a struggle inside; chairs
overturned, and there’s shooting. A regular hell-roaring
combat—and me dead on the floor all
the time.”</p>

<p>He moved to the window. Lassiter was nowhere
in sight.</p>

<p>“Flat against the house between the window
and the door,” he decided; then aloud to Freel,
“Anyone with you?”</p>

<p>“Not a soul,” Freel lied.</p>

<p>“Better so; maybe we can figure out some
little bet whereby it would be to your advantage
to help me come clear of this charge.” He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
now fully clothed and he crossed to the door without
permitting his boot heels to touch the floor.
“Can’t find a match,” he complained, fumbling at
the catch. “Come in and strike a light while I
hop into my clothes. I’m in my nightie.” He
opened the door, standing back from the streak
of moonlight which streamed through. Freel
would shoot if he saw that Carver was already
dressed.</p>

<p>“I’ll just wait here,” Freel said.</p>

<p>“And pot me as I step out,” Carver mentally
completed.</p>

<p>“You’ll be out on bond in an hour,” Freel
resumed. His head was within a foot of the door
as he attempted to peer inside.</p>

<p>Carver swung his gun with deadly precision
and Freel collapsed without a word as the heavy
weapon descended solidly upon his skull. Before
the deputy had fairly struck the ground Carver
was peering round the door jamb with the gun
levelled on Lassiter who was flattened against
the house some three feet from the door.</p>

<p>“Steady! Let it slide out of your hand!”
Carver ordered.</p>

<p>Lassiter’s slow brain had scarcely grasped the
fact that his plans had gone amiss, and even as
the hand which held his gun relaxed in response<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
to the order, Carver took one swift half step
round the door and swung his own weapon again.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he had saddled and was riding
out of town. As he cleared it, he chanted a
verse wherein the tumbleweed rebuked the sluggish
pumpkin for sticking to its garden patch as
Thanksgiving day approached.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“You can lay right there and wait</div>
<div class="verse">To be turned into pies and tarts,</div>
<div class="verse">But me, I’ll jump the fence right now</div>
<div class="verse">And head for other parts.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Freel’s bringing me in feet first, like he’d
planned, could be easy explained,” Carver reflected.
“But a live active prisoner is different.
The last thing in this world he’d want is to book
me for trial. I couldn’t force myself on him as a
captive. Next time I meet Freel out in company
I’ll surrender and insist that he puts me
under arrest.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cook wagon lumbered down Cabin Creek
toward the Salt Fork of the Arkansas. A dozen
hands, riding in couplets, straggled irregularly
behind. The bed wagon followed and the horse
wrangler brought up the rear with the <i>remuda</i>
which numbered some two hundred head of
horses, including the string of extra mounts for
each round-up hand who rode with the Half Diamond
H wagon.</p>

<p>A rider waited on the far bank of the Salt
Fork with his string of extra horses and the men
speculated idly as to whether he represented
Crowfoot or the Coldstream Pool, it being the
custom to exchange “reps” to ride with neighboring
wagons. The horseman proved to be Bart
Lassiter, repping for Crowfoot. Carver’s intimation
as to Crowfoot’s methods and their possible
connection with the X I L trail herd, dropped
on the occasion of his last visit with Molly Lassiter,
had borne fruit. The Half Diamond H
crew had been full-handed but the girl had induced
Bart to ride with their wagon as Crowfoot’s
rep instead of accompanying his half-brothers
to the X I L.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Lassiter threw his extra mounts in with the
<i>remuda</i> and joined Carver, who opened up on
him without parley.</p>

<p>“I tendered you the key to my little house so
that you could use it for living purposes,” he said,
“but without any notion that you’d start up in
business. From all that I can gather you set
out to abate the thirst of the whole Cherokee
Nation.”</p>

<p>“Well, the poor devils are fixed up every other
way,” Bart explained. “They draw beef rations,
flour rations, blanket issues and so on, but nobody’s
ever been thoughtful enough to provide
them with licker rations, so they’re forced to live
a one-sided, unbalanced kind of existence and I
was striving to supply the lack and sort of round
out their lives.”</p>

<p>“An’ you came near to finishing mine,” Carver
stated.</p>

<p>“It was only that once,” Bart defended. “I
did dispose of several cases at a right handsome
profit and you’ve no notion how much they enjoyed
theirselves the next night. It would have
done your heart good to have heard it. All Caldwell
turned out to listen to the expansive sounds
emanating from the Cherokee camp south of
town.”</p>

<p>Carver had placed that first illusive impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
that Molly Lassiter was in grave need of something
without which her life was not quite complete.
It was no material requirement but a need
that was deeper than that. She despised the
ways of the two older half-brothers, who had been
practically strangers to her during her own early
life, showing up at her father’s home but infrequently.
Later, after her own mother’s death,
they had returned and made it their home. There
had never been any bond between them and herself,
and she had feared the effect their ways
might exercise upon Bart. Freel had spoken the
truth when he asserted that she knew what it was
to have the law always barking at her door. Carver
knew now that what she most needed was
peace,—assurance that the same old conditions
would not pertain to her life and Bart’s.</p>

<p>“Why do you put Molly up against that sort
of thing?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“She didn’t know,” Bart returned.</p>

<p>“But she’d know if they happened to clamp
down on you for it,” Carver insisted. “And
that’s what she’s guarding against. She’s always
had that sort of thing to fight off.”</p>

<p>“She has for a fact,” Bart admitted. “The
old man was a hard citizen himself, way back in
his youth. He’d quieted down for a good many
years but after the two boys came back he sort of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
leaned their way again. There’s been times when
Molly and me was kids, and left all alone in the
house or wherever we happened to be at the time,
that folks would come round inquiring about his
whereabouts, and the old man hiding out in the
hills about them. She thought a lot of him, Molly
did, and hated Milt and Noll for leading him off.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you shake them?” Carver
demanded. “There’s no common bond between
you and them, and Molly would be way better
off.”</p>

<p>“I’ve made the break now and again,” Bart
explained. “But they always turn up. Our
family line-up is fashioned after that fabled joint
snake. You can disrupt the critter but the pieces
crawl back together again and all stand united.”</p>

<p>“If there’s any more midnight visits made at
my cabin,” said Carver; “there’ll be one middle
joint absent from the next family reunion.”</p>

<p>“I take it you’re referring to Noll,” said Bart.
“If you’ll only accept my earnest advice you’ll
decoy Noll off to some quiet spot and snap a cap
at him. I promise it won’t upset me a bit.”</p>

<p>On the third day out from the ranch Carver
rode with Nate Younger along a low ridge
studded with a straggling stand of black-jack
timber. The old man’s face was stern and set as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
he viewed the procession filing for two miles
along the open bottoms below them.</p>

<p>A dozen round-up crews made up the picture,
for this was a coöperative move by all the outfits
ranging in the Strip, the great final combing of
stock from the unowned lands.</p>

<p>Far up the valley, a mere speck in the distance,
the Half Diamond H wagon led the way while
the others trailed at intervals. Two hundred
riders, the personnel probably including the most
efficient body of cowhands in the world, straggled
up the bottoms in irregular formation. The
extra horses, if combined into one <i>cavayado</i>
would number over two thousand head. A group
of riders hovered near the last wagon, it having
encountered difficulties in making the crossing of
the Cimarron, resuming their way as the quick-sands
relinquished their sucking hold upon the
wheels and the floundering horses snaked the
lumbering vehicle out upon the solid shore. A
band of twenty Cherokees flanked the <i>cavalcade</i>
and dashed from one outfit to the next, begging
food from each wagon boss in turn. Midway of
the procession a detachment of cavalry rode in
double file while the officer in command conferred
with the man in charge of that particular wagon.
As Carver watched they dropped back abreast of
the next in line and he knew the message delivered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
to each one in turn by the soldiery,—the
instructions to make a thorough sweep and clear
every head of stock from the Cherokee Strip.</p>

<p>The Indians, having gathered contributions
sufficient for the moment, including a steer which
was pointed out to them by the owner of the
brand worn by the animal, hazed this moveable
meat supply to the crest of an adjacent knoll and
there dropped it with an accompaniment of rifle
shots. Younger waved a hand toward the scene
spread out before him.</p>

<p>“That’s the way I saw the Old West first,” he
said. “The picture is mighty near identical; the
wagons rolling along just like that, only drawn
up in more tight formation; the <i>cavayado</i> trailing
under guard, holding all the extra horses of the
settlers; maybe a band of marauding reds clustered
off to one side like them that are hacking up
that steer; sometimes a little escort of troopers
helping us at bad crossings where the Kiowas
and Comanches was most liable to jump us while
a part of the train was bogged down in the sand.
The wagons was more likely dragged by bulls
than horses then, and buffalo was scattered round
the landscape in place of range cows, but on the
whole the picture tallies close enough.” The old
man turned his gaze away. “That’s the way we
was first ushered into the Old West, son. Maybe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
it’s fitting that we’re being similarly ushered out
of the last bit that’s left for us.”</p>

<p>They rode on in silence and regained the head
of the line. The various wagons made camp at
intervals sufficient to permit the <i>remudas</i> of different
outfits to be held on good grass at widely
separate points to prevent the possibility of their
mixing. On this occasion the men rode from one
night camp to the next to renew old friendships,
fraternizing with the hands who rode for rival
brands. Another crew of similar magnitude had
assembled at another point in the Strip and during
this same hour these men too were mingling
from one outfit to the next. Perhaps among the
entire three hundred odd gathered at these two
points there was not one man who fully realized
that this meeting was to be the last of its sort; not
one who could even partly vision the circumstances
of the next.</p>

<p>Never again in history were these men to
gather as a whole on the open range. This night
was the last. Many would meet in the future;
others would never meet again. Some would be
neighbors for a lifetime and it was slated that
the trails of others should cross in far places.
Perhaps it is well that it is not given to man to
look far into the future. This last occasion was
not marred by any thought that the summons for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
the next gathering would not go forth for more
than a quarter of a century. There were many
present who would heed that plea which would
one day be issued for all the old-time peelers and
bronc fighters of the Cherokee lands to assemble
for a final rally. They would not then travel
across the open range with chuck wagons and
saddle horse. Some would be carried in luxuriously
appointed coaches that roared along steel
rails; others in glittering vehicles that purred
swiftly along fenced and well-kept highways;
some would arrive in strange craft that swept
across the skies above thriving western cities situated
on spots now widely known as ideal cow-camp
sites. A few indeed, but very few, would
come in buckboards or ride in on horses, their
ropes coiled on ancient saddles; and it would be
these latter ones who would then appear strange
and out of place. But no such glimpse of future
actualities troubled the men as they sought
friends who worked with other wagons. There
was a general disposition to scoff at the notion
that there would be no more cows ranged on the
Strip. Even if it were opened for entry it would
be long before there were sufficient settlers to
take up any great percentage of the range. The
settlement of any country was a slow and tedious
process. In any event there were long years of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
life in the open—the only sort of existence
which they could endure with satisfaction—stretching
forth ahead of them; so why concern
themselves over vague possibilities of the future?
That was the general attitude of them all, excepting
old Nate and his contemporaries, men
who, like himself, were being ushered out of their
domain as they had been ushered in a generation
past. Their day was passing and they knew it.</p>

<p>Throughout the following day various wagons
turned aside to the right or left, branching away
toward some far spot allotted to them, there to
begin the first actual work. In the late afternoon
the Half Diamond H wagon made its stand
on a creek that flowed to the Cimarron from the
low watershed between that stream and the North
Fork of the Canadian. The cook’s summons
brought the men tumbling from their bed rolls an
hour before dawn. The night hawk hazed the
<i>remuda</i> into a corral fashioned by a single rope
stretched between stakes sledged solidly into the
sod, and after breakfasting the men entered in
pairs, each to rope a circle horse of his own particular
string. In the first light of day Younger
led off up a ridge to the main divide flanking the
creek to the left and turned upstream along it.
Other reps had joined the wagon and there were
now nearly twenty riders following where he led.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
At the head of each draw he detailed one or two
men to work it. When half of the crew had been
assigned to cover certain stretches Younger
dropped again to the bottoms, mounted to the opposite
divide and moved downstream in a similar
fashion until even with the wagon, working the
last draw himself.</p>

<p>The riders combed the scrub-oak side hills and
the gulches, shoving all stock before them to the
bottoms and heading them upstream. The first
riders to finish their details were stationed across
the valley to halt the cows brought in by others.
The chuck wagon had lumbered on up the creek
to the point from which the next circle would be
thrown. The night hawk had gone off duty with
sunrise but the wrangler held the <i>remuda</i> in a
rope corral. While a part of the men held the
herd the others repaired to this enclosure and
caught fresh horses, those who were to engage in
the next gathering swing putting their ropes on
circle mounts, while those detailed to bring up the
day herd caught trained cow horses belonging to
their individual strings.</p>

<p>In a breeding-ranch country the herd would
have been worked on the spot, calves roped and
ironed with the brand worn by their mothers, and
only the beef steers cut into a day herd, the she-stuff
and all stock younger than two-year-olds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
being allowed to scatter once more on the range.
But there were no calves to brand, no she-stock
on the range, for of late the cowmen of the Strip
had come to follow one set rule in accord with the
transition of the cow business, forming an intermediate
link between the old-time cattle kings of
the open range and the modern feeders of the
corn belt. For beef raising, instead of a one-outfit
business from start to finish, had come to be a
business of progression induced by the necessities
of later-day conditions. Big breeding ranches
were now mainly confined to the vast wastes of
Texas and the Southwest and to similar stretches
in the ranges of the Northwest.</p>

<p>The breeding ranches of Texas and New
Mexico now gathered their steers as two-year-olds
and sold them to the intermediate beef-brands
operating in the Strip, the short-grass
plains of Western Kansas and the Sandhill country
of Nebraska. Here they were ranged on
grass till they had turned four-year-olds, then
resold to the feeders of Missouri, Iowa and Illinois,
who corn-fed and fattened and finished them
for market. Except for one breeding ranch confined
to a great fenced-in pasture, there was only
beef stuff in the whole expanse of the Strip, which
rendered the round-up a comparatively simple
affair. This last event in particular was simplified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
by the orders which had just gone forth from
governmental sources, and every head of stock
gathered in each circle was held in the day herd.</p>

<p>The rope corral was dismantled, ropes and
stakes loaded on the bed wagon which promptly
headed up country, trailed by the wrangler with
the <i>remuda</i>, and Carver led all the hands except
those detailed with the day herd up the bottoms
toward the new stand of the cook wagon. It was
but ten o’clock when they dropped from their
horses and fell ravenously upon a hot meal which
the cook had already prepared, for while the cowhand’s
day begins an hour before dawn his nooning
comes at ten and his knock-off time is seldom
later than five P. M.</p>

<p>The second circle of the day was completed in
the late afternoon. The hands feasted to repletion
and lolled about for an hour, buzzing angrily
over a new rumor which had just reached camp.
The men spread their bed rolls on the ground and
retired with the setting sun.</p>

<p>Carver dropped instantly asleep but contrary
to his usual custom he waked within an hour and
sleep would not come to him as he tossed restlessly
in his blankets. The turmoil of the round-up,
the hoarse bawls emanating from the throats
of five hundred steers, the shrill yelps of riders,
the stifling dust of daytime activities; all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
had been superseded by the night sounds of the
cow camp in the open. A cool breeze stole across
the range which now seemed mysteriously hushed.
Occasionally some night horse on picket or tied to
the stake ropes shifted uneasily and stamped a
restless foot. The night hawk held the <i>cavayado</i>
on good grass somewhere down the bottoms and
his voice drifted faintly to Carver as he sang to
while away the lonely hours. The night guards
on duty with the herd were likewise singing to
soothe their charges on the bed ground a few hundred
yards above the wagon, and fragmentary
snatches of their melodies floated down to Carver’s
ears as he blinked sleeplessly up at the stars.
He remained awake till the hour came to stand
his turn on second guard and he rolled out,
mounted his night horse and rode with several
others to relieve the weary riders who had stood
the first shift of the night after a fourteen-hour
day in the saddle.</p>

<p>As Carver circled the bed ground his thoughts
were still concerned with the text of the rumor
so recently set afloat. It was said that not only
cows, but men would be ordered from the unowned
lands; that every foot of fence must be
removed from the range and brand owners forced
to abandon home ranches. Bart Lassiter joined
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“Well, what do you think of our latest bit of
news?” he asked. “Think they’ll go through
with it?”</p>

<p>“It don’t seem reasonable that they’d put over
any such drastic measure,” Carver said. “They
might. It will be hard on the old man if they
do.”</p>

<p>A figure rode toward him in the moonlight and
the old man in question joined him as Lassiter
departed. Nate too had been restless and had
found himself unable to sleep. As Carver had reflected
that such a move would inflict an undeserved
hardship upon his employer, so Nate was
wondering as to what effect it would have upon
his hands, for in common with all cowmen of his
type, Younger was proud of the accomplishments
of his riders.</p>

<p>Every brand owner would stand back of the
men who rode for him; every rider evidenced a
similar devotion to the owner’s interests,—a
loyalty to the brand for which he worked. Perhaps
in all history there has never been another
calling which has inspired the same allegiance
throughout its entire personnel. A man must be
proficient in many lines to qualify as a cowhand.
First of all he must be a horseman capable of
mastering any horse on the range and of training
his mounts to perform the various and intricate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
duties required of them; a roper of parts, able to
front-foot a calf or to rope and hog-tie a mighty
range bull with equal facility; sufficiently skilled
in blacksmithing to shoe his own horses; for these
and many other acquirements, working at them
sixteen hours a day, he was paid a lesser sum than
any unskilled laborer received for ten hours of
far less gruelling work. It was the wild free life,
not the pay, which held him to his chosen calling.
The driving spring rains which soaked his bed roll
as he slept on wet ground in the open; the shrivelling
heat of summer and the shrieking blasts of
winter blizzards; the congenial companionship of
round-up days and the long lonely vigils at isolated
winter line camps; all these he chose in
preference to the softer life and greater pay of
other less strenuous pursuits.</p>

<p>“What will all the boys be doing in another
season?” Younger asked. “Where’ll they all go
when there’s no more range work for them to
do?”</p>

<p>“Texas maybe,” Carver predicted. “Or New
Mexico.”</p>

<p>“Both those countries are coming to be overrun
with nesters,” Nate returned. “The big
brands are getting their range cut up right now.
They’ve been forced to reduce the size of their
outfits in proportion to the decrease in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
range. There’s more cowhands down there now
than there are jobs to go around.”</p>

<p>“Then maybe the Northwest range country,”
Carver suggested.</p>

<p>“The surplus bronc peelers of Texas and New
Mexico have been drifting up there for the last
ten years,” Nate stated. “They’re a drug on the
market right now, cowhands are. And they’re
irrigating that Northwest country rapid and cutting
up the range. Once they settle the Strip, all
the boys down there will have to go into other
lines. That’s sure.”</p>

<p>The herd was worked and reworked almost
daily as cows wearing brands that ranged in different
parts of the Strip were culled out and
turned over to some wagon crew whose ultimate
destination lay in that direction. All along a
two-hundred-mile front more than a score of
wagons were operating in unison. Owners ranging
south of the Strip sent parties up to trail-herd
back any of their stock that had wandered to
these parts. These men brought with them little
bunches of Half Diamond H cows and others
that had drifted from the Strip to southern
ranges. Some came from beyond the Canadian
and at least one little assortment had been
combed from the distant Washita. Younger, in
common with other large owners of his neighborhood,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
maintained drift fences and line camps to
prevent the drifting of his stock from the home
range. Even with these precautions there was a
certain annual leakage, but the percentage of
Half Diamond H cows gathered south of the
Cimarron was small.</p>

<p>Day after day as the round-up progressed the
men threshed out the fate of the unowned lands.
It constituted the sole topic of discussion whenever
two riders met on the circle or paused to converse
as they stood their turn on night guard. It
filled that brief period of general indolence in
which they indulged each evening before taking
to their beds with the setting sun. Carver, perhaps
to a greater extent than any of them, had anticipated
certain transitions. He had correctly
interpreted the presence of those white-topped
wagons camped along the line and knew what
they portended, yet even now he found it impossible
to give credence to such drastic changes as
were predicted by old Nate and others of his
kind. He sought for an analogous example and
found it in the settling process which Kansas had
been undergoing for a period of forty years; yet
throughout the whole western half of that State
ranches of five to fifty thousand acres were the
rule. In view of this circumstance he could not
quite conceive of the vast expanse of the unowned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
lands being cut up into quarter sections in the
space of a few short years. It would all take
time. He advanced this idea to Younger on a
day some three weeks out from the ranch.</p>

<p>“All this talk about men being ordered out of
the Strip,” he said. “How are they going about
that? I’ve seen the squatter outfits rolling up to
the line and making camp. But we’ve had similar
demonstrations before now; that year the boomers
fired the grass for one; and nothing came of it.
They were ordered out. Even if they let ’em in
it will take years to settle up the Strip.”</p>

<p>Younger nodded abstractly. Since that event
had cost him a thousand head of cows it was but
natural that the incident was still fresh in his
mind. A few years past a swarm of squatters
had invaded the unowned lands in the face of all
regulations. When the cowmen had sought to
expel them after they had refused to obey the
government’s order to move out, the boomers had
scattered and fired the parched fall grass and
stock had died by thousands throughout the
burned areas. The negro cavalry had been sent
in to enforce the regulations and were thereafter
stationed at Caldwell, patrolling the line and
turning back all insistent settlers who would
enter. Now the Negro troopers had been withdrawn
and a second invasion seemed imminent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>“I know, son; but this time things will be reserved,”
Nate prophesied. “Then they ruled the
squatters out and stood by us. This time they’ve
ruled us out instead.”</p>

<p>“They’ll open it for entry,” Carver agreed.
“It’s come to that and it’s likely we can’t postpone
it. But this notion that the whole of the
Cherokee country will be settled up solid in a few
years’ time seems overdrawn.”</p>

<p>“A few months’ time, boy,” the old man corrected.
“More likely a few weeks will do the
trick.”</p>

<p>Carver’s thoughts reverted to a similar prediction
made by Hinman, “It’ll be one hair-raising,
mad stampede,” old Joe had said. But Carver
still dissented.</p>

<p>“It’ll take nearly fifty thousand families to
file on every quarter section in the Strip,” he said.
“They’ll come eventually. I know that. But
where will that many come from in a few weeks’
time?”</p>

<p>“Son, they’ll come from every odd corner of
the country,” Younger stated. “They’ll swarm
in and settle down in clouds like blackbirds in a
cane field. She’ll be the damnedest, wildest
scramble a man will ever live to witness. I’m
telling you.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">V</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stockyards had been the scene of feverish
activity for weeks. The loading pens were
crowded to capacity and throughout every hour
of the day and night there sounded the bawls of
thirsty cattle and the shrill yelps of cowhands as
they urged unwilling steers through the loading
chutes. Long trainloads of cows rolled out of
Caldwell in swift succession and loading was resumed
as soon as empty cattle cars could be obtained.
An antiquated switch engine wheezed
noisily as it shunted cars along the switches and
spotted them at the chutes. Day by day the congestion
increased. The quarantine belt swarmed
with stock, as some two hundred thousand head
had been gathered from the Cherokee lands for
shipment. In addition to these the regular run
of summer business from the south continued as
the trail herds from Texas and New Mexico came
plodding up to add to the congestion.</p>

<p>Money flowed back into Caldwell in steady
streams as trainloads of cattle were converted
into cash on the Kansas City and Chicago markets.
Many owners, having been deprived of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
their range by the stringent orders, found themselves
unable to reinvest in cows the funds received
from recent shipments. In their restlessness
many of these turned to the green tables for
relaxation and there were stud games where hundreds
and often thousands were wagered on the
turn of every card. All the cowhands of the
Strip were banked up in the quarantine belt,
holding the cows of their employers on grass until
such time as they could be cleared and shipped.
In their leisure hours they swarmed the streets of
Caldwell. Added to these were the trail-herd
crews from the whole Southwest, among them
many Mexican peelers with their tremendous
hats, silver-mounted saddles and three-inch silver
rowels.</p>

<p>Four troops of cavalry were camped along the
line and troopers mingled with the crowds. Caldwell,
the last of the old-time cow towns, had now
entered upon her last wild fling. It was now
definitely known that in three months’ time the
Cherokee Strip would be thrown open for settlement
and the homeless from all corners of the
country were already beginning to assemble.
For weeks on end there was not a room available
in town and men spread their campbeds in vacant
lots. Eating places were crowded to capacity
and new restaurants were being opened up in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
frame shacks or even in tents wherever vacant
sites were available. As always, where business
is rushing and money freely flowing, there were
symptoms of a boom. It was openly predicted
that the settling of the country to the southward
would throw Caldwell into the enviable position
of the one logical metropolis of the whole Southwest.</p>

<p>Cowmen cursed the troopers, seeing in them
the visible symbol of that authority which had excluded
them from their rightful domain. The
unowned lands were thoroughly patrolled and
detachments of cavalry were camped at strategic
points throughout the Strip. It was this latter
circumstance which had upset Carver’s calculations.
He had planned with Bart Lassiter to
hold a bunch of six hundred of Younger’s three-year-old
steers on the forbidden range for a
period of one year, receiving a substantial proportion
of the increased price which they would
bring as four-year-olds. Both Carver and Nate
Younger had seen the futility of the attempt.
Others had entertained similar ideas but had
abandoned them as events moved swiftly past the
farthest bounds of their previous comprehensions
and rendered their hopes untenable.</p>

<p>Carver, once assured that his plans for the immediate
future must be relinquished, cast about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
for some substitute occupation which might prove
equally remunerative. He rode away from
Younger after their mutual decision, spinning
his lone coin into the air and catching it as his
horse jogged slowly across the range.</p>

<p>“It appears as if it’s going to be real difficult
to provide you with all the company I’d counted
on,” he said. “Time is skipping right along and
here you are—occupying my pocket all by yourself
without even one mate to jingle up against.
Only last week I had it all mapped out to gather
in several thousand of your sort to keep you
company. But that plan’s flown out the window
and here I am without one idea to work on.”</p>

<p>He turned along the south line fence of the
Half Diamond H leases.</p>

<p>“Little lonely dollar, you must mount up to a
million,” he asserted. “But we’ve got to insert
our wedge somewheres right soon and start to
mounting.”</p>

<p>His eye traveled along the fence line to where
it disappeared in the distance, and suddenly he
turned and rode back to where the outfit was
camped and sought out the boss.</p>

<p>“About those fences being ordered down,” he
said. “What arrangements have you made?”</p>

<p>“Not any,” Nate admitted. “What with
gathering eight thousand head of steers and shipping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
’em I haven’t taken time off to worry over
fences. We’ll have the last steer headed north in
a few days now. Then I’ll see about scrapping
fences—or let the squatters tear ’em down when
they come in to roost.”</p>

<p>“It won’t leave you short-handed now if Bart
Lassiter and I lay off,” Carver suggested. “You
lend me a team and wagon from the home place
and we’ll snatch out those fences for what material
there is in them.”</p>

<p>“The fence is yours,” Younger agreed. “Provided
the other half-owners of any stretches are
agreeable. Go get it.”</p>

<p>Lassiter assented instantly when Carver stated
the proposition.</p>

<p>“I always did feel suffocated in a fence country,”
he announced. “I was always so much opposed
to seeing every fence go up that I figure it
will be a real entertaining pastime to help tear
’em down.”</p>

<p>This spirit of optimism lasted during the two
days required to hunt up other part owners of
certain stretches and get their endorsement of
the plan, his enthusiasm lasting through the first
few days of actual work. They were out before
sunrise and knocked off after dark, pulling posts,
coiling wire and freighting the materials to the
Half Diamond H home ranch. His interest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
lagged but he did not openly rebel until after
two thirds of the fence had been salvaged. Carver
roused him one morning for breakfast and
Bart blinked sleepily at the smoky lantern that
lighted the sod hut in which they had stayed overnight.</p>

<p>“We’ve got enough wire piled up to enclose
the State of Texas,” he stated. “There’s thirty
miles of three-wire fence we’ve collected if there’s
a foot. That’s twenty-nine miles more than both
of us will ever need. Let’s leave the rest of her
set.”</p>

<p>“But we contracted to scrap the whole of it,”
Carver dissented. “Another week will see us
through.”</p>

<p>“A week!” Lassiter moaned. “I just can’t
face it, honest. I’ve reformed. I hope I hang if
I ever extract another staple.”</p>

<p>“A week’s not such a long stretch,” Carver
urged.</p>

<p>“Donald, I’ll break down and cry if you lead
me up to just one other measly fence post,” Lassiter
announced. “You take my half and let me
off. I’ve got to amble over to Crowfoot’s and
draw my spring wages. Then, too, I’d ought
to collect Molly and get her settled somewhere in
Caldwell. She’s all alone over on Turkey
Creek.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“I’ll pay you thirty dollars for what time
you’ve put in—sometime when I’ve got it—and
take over your wire and finish the job myself,”
Carver at last conceded. “You can locate Molly
in my little plant in Caldwell; only mark me
now! There’ll be no more balancing of Cherokee
rations conducted on the premises. I’ll remonstrate
with you at some length if I catch you at
it again.”</p>

<p>Carver worked on alone and at the end of
another ten days he viewed with satisfaction the
numerous coils of fence wire and the great stack
of posts neatly corded behind the deserted buildings
of the Half Diamond H.</p>

<p>“At present that assortment is only wood and
iron,” he said. “But it’s a real imposing pile
nevertheless, and I can likely convert it into dollars
when the squatters come romping in.”</p>

<p>When he rode into Caldwell he was amazed at
the swift transitions. The incoming transients
had trebled the population in the last two months.
Being unprepared for this sweeping change he
was all the more prepared to lend a willing ear
to the prediction that Caldwell was to become
the metropolis of the whole Southwest. There
was a conversational boom in progress and Carver,
looking upon the crowded, teeming streets,
the numerous tent houses everywhere in evidence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
and the new frame shacks in the process of construction
through the town, divined the possibility
of actual boom days just ahead. He rode
out to his little frame cabin to visit with Molly
Lassiter whom he had seen but three times in as
many months. He found neither Bart nor Molly
at home but the door was unlocked and he entered.</p>

<p>The two rooms of the bare little shack had been
transformed. Two worn Navajo rugs were
spread on the pine-board floor and soft curtain
materials were draped across the windows.</p>

<p>“She’s made it all homelike,” Carver said.
“Just with a touch here and there. What
couldn’t she do with things to work with and a
real house to operate on? We’ll give her one
some day if only she’ll agree.” He drew forth
the lucky dollar and consulted it. “Let’s you
and me hatch out a new idea,” he invited. “We
can’t be loafing on the job.”</p>

<p>While the idea was hatching he sat peering
abstractedly through the doorway, rousing from
his reverie only when he found his gaze riveted
on the girl as she turned into the pathway leading
to the house. Molly halted suddenly when within
a few feet of the door, as she saw him sitting just
inside it.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t expected you this soon,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>“Bart told me the fence job would keep you
another month at least. Did you decide not to
finish it?”</p>

<p>“It’s salvaged to the last strand of wire,” he
returned. “I speeded up some so as to have it
over with.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry Bart quit,” she said. “You see
he won’t stick at anything.”</p>

<p>“Don’t know as I blame him,” said Carver.
“The last few days I’ve developed a downright
aversion to the sight of fence wire myself. Glad
to see me?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “I’ll be out of here and
established in a room of my own so that you can
have your house by to-morrow, Don. I’ve been
waiting for the present occupants to vacate.”</p>

<p>“You stay right on here,” he insisted. “I
won’t be needing it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Don, but I can’t do that,” she said.
“I have to stop floating and find some nook of
my own. I can’t follow Bart around any longer.
For three years now we’ve drifted from one spot
to the next; sometimes in line camps; more frequently
in some rooming house in any town where
we happened to be, always knowing that wherever
it was it wouldn’t be home for long. I didn’t
mind at first, for I was trying to keep Bart away
from Milt and Noll; but they always turn up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
again and he follows them off. I’d love even a
sod house if only I could call it my own and know
I wouldn’t have to move out on an hour’s notice.
I’m sick of gypsying. I want to feel settled—feel
that I’m attached!”</p>

<p>He reached over and rested a hand on her
shoulder.</p>

<p>“I know, Honey,” he said. “So do I. That’s
exactly my own frame of mind. The best way all
round is for you and me to get attached and
settle. Won’t you?”</p>

<p>She felt that he had failed to grasp the fact of
what a sense of permanency would mean to her
after the nomadic existence she had followed for
the past few years.</p>

<p>“Listen, Molly,” he said, divining something
of her thoughts. “It’s not the way a man says a
thing but the way he means it that really counts.
And I was meaning that a lot.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t even know to-day what you’re
going to do to-morrow,” she said. “It would be
only exchanging one state of gypsying for another.
Don’t you see that?”</p>

<p>He did, at least, see that the moment was not
right and he settled back into his chair and twisted
a cigarette.</p>

<p>“You always lean to the dark side of things,”
he accused. “Most complaints I’ve heard about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
family strife was occasioned because menfolks
generally were so occupied with business that
they didn’t spend much time at home. Now with
me not having any special business it would leave
me free to put in most of my time around the
house. There’s that advantage.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she laughed. “There’s that. Sometimes,
Don, I almost wish you really were a settled
sort of a soul; but that time will never be.”</p>

<p>Carver crooned softly:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="first">“Oh, I’m a rolling rambler,”</div>
<div class="verse">Said the speeding tumbleweed.</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="first">“But I’d rather be a wild, wild weed</div>
<div class="verse">Than a sluggish yellow squash:”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>“And I’d so much rather be a pumpkin
than the wildest of all wild weeds,” she said.
“There’s only that little difference between the
two of us.”</p>

<p>“Tell me,” he urged, “what sort of a quiet
home life do you pine for most? Does your preference
run to a cottage in town or stray off
towards a dwelling in the country?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“The country,” she returned. “Somewhere
on a farm where I could watch things grow.”</p>

<p>“That’s my choice too,” he confessed. “Whatever
business I settle on will have to be at the
source of things. Like you said, I want to watch
things grow—calves or crops, it don’t much
matter which. I’ll start casting about for a farm
right off.”</p>

<p>After leaving her he mingled with the swarming
crowds on the main street. The conversational
boom was in full swing and he heard it discussed
on all sides. There were but few who dissented
from the general prediction that an era
of great prosperity lay ahead for Caldwell. Carver
put in three active hours, then sought out
Nate Younger to draw his back wages for the
spring work, a sum totalling a trifle less than two
hundred dollars.</p>

<p>He found Younger in his room at the hotel in
conference with Joe Hinman. The two old cowmen
had pooled resources and formed the Plains
Land and Cattle Company, Younger having purchased
grasslands adjoining Hinman’s holdings.
They planned to make the new concern a beef
ranch straight through instead of a breeding
ranch as now operated by Hinman.</p>

<p>“We’ll be the biggest outfit in this end of the
State,” Hinman was predicting, as Carver thrust<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
his head through the door. “Come in, son, and
set on the bed. The Plains Land and Cattle
Company is going to be the biggest of the lot.”</p>

<p>“I’m counting some on organizing a similar
concern myself,” said Carver. “Maybe a trifle
smaller than yours just at first; and in order to
make the start I’ve got to borrow somewhat. I’m
owning a nine-hundred-dollar equity in that
bunch of calves we made the deal for last spring.
How about your lending me eight hundred
against it?”</p>

<p>“But that would leave you owing me thirteen
hundred on the bunch,” Hinman objected.
“And right now those calves wouldn’t fetch that
price on the market.”</p>

<p>“Set the date for maturity of the loan far
enough ahead so they’ll grow into it,” Carver
suggested. “Before it comes due they’ll have
advanced way beyond that figure. Then if I
don’t pay up you can close me out at a profit.”</p>

<p>“Now ain’t that a fact!” Hinman exclaimed
admiringly. “There was a time, Buddy, when I
marvelled at your ability to shed a season’s wages
overnight. It does look now as if you might also
learn me a few tricks on the reverse side of things.
You’ve got a business mind.”</p>

<p>He produced a check book and a stub of pencil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“How long do you want this loan to run?”
Carver asked.</p>

<p>“According to your own figures the longer it
runs the more I stand to make,” said Hinman.
“So I don’t know as it makes much difference.
It does appear as if you’d let me in on a pretty
good thing—so set the date yourself.”</p>

<p>“One year from to-day,” Carver decided.</p>

<p>“What do you aim to do with all this money?”
Hinman inquired. “Setting out to break the
bank in the Gilded Eagle?”</p>

<p>“I’ve purchased a building,” Carver proclaimed.</p>

<p>“You’ve which?” said Hinman. “What
building?”</p>

<p>“Pirie’s place; down in the next block,” Carver
informed. “It’s got a grocery business on
the ground floor and the grocer’s wife rents room
upstairs.”</p>

<p>He extended a contract and Hinman perused
it, observing that Carver had agreed to purchase
at three thousand dollars, paying six hundred
down and a like amount each year.</p>

<p>“I’d rented my little shack,” Carver explained.
“Only to find that there wasn’t a room
for rent in town; not one! It was either buy a
place of my own or set up.”</p>

<p>“It’ll save you considerable room rent,” Hinman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
agreed, “you being in town easy three nights
out of the year. But what’s the final object?”</p>

<p>“Each season those calves will be worth more
and I can borrow enough additional against them
to meet the payments,” Carver pointed out.
“Meantime the grocer pays me thirty dollars
rent money every month, which gives me a steady
income to live off till such time as I can turn the
building at a profit and buy a tract of land to
run those calves on.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know your ambitions run toward
owning land,” said Hinman.</p>

<p>“But now since I’ve come into so much surplus
fence wire,” Carver explained, “it looks like the
only economical thing to do is to acquire a piece
of land to set inside it.”</p>

<p>“Son, you’ve mapped out a self-operating business,”
Nate Younger congratulated. “All you
have to do now is to stand back and watch it
ripen. Meantime why don’t you read up on
Belgian hares?”</p>

<p>He handed over the sum due for back wages
and Carver studied the two checks reflectively.</p>

<p>“This surplus now,” he said. “I was figuring
to put into horses. They’ll almost give you
horses nowadays just to come and drive them
off. If you don’t mind my throwing a few head
up on your range, I’ll buy up a little bunch and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
pay you fifty cents a head for pasture fees, agreeing
to get ’em off your grass November first.”</p>

<p>“We’d better let him put ’em on, Joe,” Nate
agreed. “It’s that much more security for that
loan.”</p>

<p>Even under favorable circumstances the horse
market was poor and now with all those recently
combed from the Strip as a surplus, horses could
be purchased at one’s own price. For a week
Carver rode early and late. The average run of
Indian ponies were selling for less than five
dollars a head but it was not this class of horse
flesh which Carver sought. He selected young
mares and geldings, ranging from eleven to
twelve hundred pounds in weight, which would
serve for light work stock, and eventually he
drove fifty head well toward the northern extremity
of Hinman’s range. They had cost him
an average of ten dollars apiece and he had paid
cash for half of them, issuing verbal promises to
pay for the rest. He rode back into Caldwell
with something over a hundred dollars in his
pocket.</p>

<p>The equipment of all the deserted ranches in
the unowned lands was banked up in Caldwell.
From the Coldstream Pool Carver purchased ten
sets of harness at fifteen dollars a set and three
heavy wagons at forty dollars each, paying his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
last hundred down and his personal note for the
balance.</p>

<p>Hinman witnessed this last transaction.</p>

<p>“Considering the size of your original stake
you’ve stretched it to cover considerable territory
in the last few months,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s only my surplus I’m spreading out so
thin,” Carver explained. “My capital is still
intact.” He exhibited his silver dollar. “My
one rule of life is never to impair my principal.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” Hinman encouraged. “That’s conservative
business. I was satisfied you’d play it
slow and safe.”</p>

<p>“Now if you’ll do me just one more little kindness
I’ll be grateful;” Carver said. “You and
Nate engage Freel in conversation up on the corner
where he’s standing and inside of five minutes
I’ll saunter up and direct the course of the interview.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to hear it,” Hinman said. “We’ll
detain him.”</p>

<p>Carver joined them before the appointed space
of time had elapsed.</p>

<p>“Freel, I’ve been feeling real contrite about
resisting arrest a few weeks back,” Carver said.
“I’ve decided to surrender and stand trial.”</p>

<p>The deputy marshal glanced apprehensively at
the two old cowmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“Oh—that,” he said. “Why, I’ve let that
matter drop. That’s all closed.”</p>

<p>“And it was real accommodating of you to
close it,” Carver returned, “but I can’t stand by
and see you get in trouble on my account. Orders
are orders, and you had yours. That’s the
reason I wrote this letter to Art Webb.” He
tendered an unsealed letter to the deputy. Webb
was Freel’s chief, the head United States marshal
of the district. “Webb is a good friend of mine
and I’m demanding that he inform me just why
he sent an order down here to you to pick me up.
That will put you in the clear for not rearresting
me since that night I escaped.”</p>

<p>Carver turned to his two friends.</p>

<p>“You’ve both known Webb for years,” he said.
“Did you write him like I asked you?”</p>

<p>“It clear slipped my mind,” Hinman apologized.
“I’ll get it off this evening.”</p>

<p>“Mine goes on the same mail,” Nate concurred.
“We’ll sift this thing right to the
bottom layer and clear Freel of any possible
blame.”</p>

<p>“Freel will be on my side himself if it comes
to a showdown,” Carver asserted. “He’ll be the
first to testify that I’d been away from home for
a solid month prior to the time that charge was
lodged. Some one’s tried to deal me from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
bottom, and between the four of us we’ll discover
who it is.”</p>

<p>Freel laughed and slapped Carver on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Matter of fact, that inquiry was for another
party, wanting to know if he’d turned up in these
parts,” he said. “I went and got the names
mixed. The joke’s on me—likewise the drinks,
and I’ll buy right now.”</p>

<p>He slowly tore up the letter to Webb.</p>

<p>“And here I’ve been worried almost sick,”
Carver said. “It’s a big relief to have it all
cleared up. I still owe you fifty on that little bet.
Here’s an agreement to pay in ninety days, just
as an evidence of good faith.”</p>

<p>He handed Freel a folded paper and the marshal
frowned as he read it.</p>

<p>“You’ll notice I stated why I owed it,” Carver
amplified. “You’ve always played square
with the boys—and there’s maybe a half dozen
that’s willing to step forth and declare how
you’ve always met them halfway the same as you
did with me.”</p>

<p>During the next hour Carver accosted a
dozen intimate acquaintances and told each in
turn, quite confidentially, that there was a rumor
afloat to the effect that Freel was about to resign<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
as deputy marshal and that Mattison was making
application for the post.</p>

<p>“By this time to-morrow every man in Caldwell
will have commented on this matter to Mattison
and Freel,” Carver said to Hinman. “Not
because they take any special interest in it but
just to make conversation. But the principals,
being only human and therefore self-centered,
will decide that the whole town is breathless over
their affairs. Mattison will feel his ambition
mounting and Freel will suspect that there’s been
a fire kindled under him. Now if only you and
Nate will put in your pull with Webb to give
Mattison the appointment, it looks as if things
would come out right.”</p>

<p>He rented an extra saddlehorse and invited
Molly to join him in an afternoon ride. They
jogged out past the stockyards where cowhands
prodded unwilling steers through the loading
chutes, on beyond the sound of the wheezing
switch engine and the rattle and smash of cars,
then angled westward through the quarantine
belt where riders guarded thousands of head of
cows. In the gathering dusk they rode out on
the point of a lofty knoll which afforded a view
throughout a great expanse of country.</p>

<p>“Have a last look at all this, Molly girl,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Carver said, extending an arm to the south.
“There’s yesterday.”</p>

<p>The green summer range stretched away to
the far horizon with never a plow furrow to break
it. Two trail herds had been bedded for the
night at widely separate points. A third, whose
trail boss had evidently made a hard day’s drive
to reach the quarantine belt in hope of an earlier
clearance and shipping date than that accorded
to his slower fellows, passed below the two on the
knoll and plodded northward. Two men rode the
points, the right and left forward extremities of
the herd, guiding the foremost animals on the
chosen course. One man skirted either flank and
two others rode the “drags” in the rear of the
herd to press forward any stragglers as the
weary cattle drifted slowly toward the chuck
wagon which was stationed a mile or more ahead
and where the rest of the trail-herd crew had
already gathered.</p>

<p>“That’s yesterday, girl,” Carver repeated.
“Remember all this as you see it now; the green
range and the trail herds coming up from the
south. Have a last look at it—for here comes
to-morrow,” and he pointed off to the northward.</p>

<p>Miles away across the quarantine belt a slender
ragged line extended either way beyond the
range of their vision. A thousand ribbons of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
white smoke writhed aloft and glowed in pallid
outline against the darkening sky. For two hundred
miles along the line, wherever water was
available, there was one continuous camp of
squatters, and still the land seekers increased at
the rate of two thousand families a week, all the
landless of a mighty nation gathering here to
participate in what would go down in history as
the Cherokee Run, the most frenzied stampede of
the century.</p>

<p>Both watchers felt a sudden tightening of the
throat as they gazed upon the scene, their feelings
much the same but occasioned by different
viewpoints. Carver’s sympathy was with the
riders who handled the cows on the near side of
that continuous camp, men who, like himself, had
loved the old open range, the range that was
passing for all time. The girl’s heart went out
to those homeless hosts outside the line, for she
herself was homeless and could understand the
longing which had brought them to this spot to
join in a mad and desperate rush on the chance
that they might be among the fortunate locaters
who should be first to drive their stakes on any
scrap of ground which would constitute a home.
Perhaps they too were tired of gypsying, she reflected,
and yearned for some one spot which they
might call their own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>He pointed to the tiny scattering specks that
were riders moving from point to point, then on
beyond them to that stolid line.</p>

<p>“Yonder come the pumpkins to crowd out the
tumbleweeds,” he said.</p>

<p>The soft summer night shut down and transformed
the pale smoke columns into a tortuous
trail of twinkling fires which extended for two
hundred miles along the line.</p>

<p>“We’d best be going now,” the girl said at
last. “There’s a fifteen-mile ride ahead. I’m
glad you brought me here to see all this. It
means one thing to you, Don, and exactly the
opposite to me. But it’s something we won’t
forget.”</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “We’ll not forget.”</p>

<p>They rode on in silence, the girl occupied with
her thoughts of the homeless legions who would
soon have homes, Carver content with the mere
fact of her nearness. When he decided that this
thoughtfulness had claimed her for too long a
time he recounted his transactions of the past few
days.</p>

<p>“About those responsibilities I promised you
I’d acquire,” he said, “I’m taking them on rapid.
In addition to both residence and business property
here in town, I’m owning a considerable
number of horses and a hundred head of calves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
not to mention harness, wagons and a few score
miles of good barbed wire. I’m accumulating
responsibilities so fast that there’s times I can’t
be real sure whether they’re mine or some one’s
else.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A stray</span> steer moved out of a coulee and
bawled lustily for company. The animal traveled
at a fast walk, occasionally breaking into an
awkward trot but halting frequently to loose a
plaintive bawl.</p>

<p>“He’s lonesome, that old fellow,” Carver surmised.
“And hunting hard for company.”</p>

<p>As he watched the animal he speculated idly as
to the probable number of stray steers scattered
throughout the Strip. Always there was a certain
small percentage overlooked in the round-up,
those feeding in choppy timbered breaks or
bedded in scrub-oak tangles and missed by the
circle riders who covered such stretches. These
missing ones were caught in subsequent roundups,
so it mattered little. But on this occasion
they could be charged off, Carver reflected, for
there would be no future round-up. The owners
could not afford to outfit parties to cover such a
great stretch of country for what few were left,
yet Carver estimated that there would be well
over a hundred steers still ranging the rougher
parts of the twelve thousand square miles of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
unowned lands. He pulled up his horse and
looked back at the bawling steer, then drew forth
his silver dollar and addressed it.</p>

<p>“An idea just hit me,” he asserted. “You
and I don’t believe in taking chances. Conservative,
slow and safe, like Hinman said; that’s us
every time. But we’re going to make one more
little investment in tumbleweeds before we settle
down.”</p>

<p>A few hours later he went into conference with
Nate Younger.</p>

<p>“If you’ll get most of the brand owners that
operated in the western half of the Strip to sign
an agreement whereby I get half the market
price of any of their stray steers I bring into
Caldwell I’ll outfit a combing party and go in
after them,” Carver offered.</p>

<p>“They’d sign up quick enough,” Younger
stated. “Jump at the chance in fact. But if the
owners themselves figure they can’t prorate the
expense of a trip like that and come out ahead,
how does it come you see a profit in footing all
the expense for only half the proceeds?”</p>

<p>“Just a whim of mine,” Carver answered.</p>

<p>“Another point you’re overlooking is the
nature of a steer,” Younger protested. “Once
he gets lonesome he’ll bawl and travel and attach
himself to the first trail herd that drifts through.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Did you ever consider that little kink in the
make-up of a steer?”</p>

<p>“It was through studying over that very point
that I acquired the notion,” Carver said.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Younger. “Yes, I see. All
right, son, I’ll sign them up.”</p>

<p>“There’s the trail bosses of forty different
Texas brands in town,” Carver continued.
“And there’s a dozen or so I’d like to sign up on
the same basis. I’ll go out and interview them
while you fix up the others.”</p>

<p>“But you won’t find any Texas strays in this
end of the Strip,” Younger predicted. “A trail
boss isn’t so much averse to letting an off-brand
join his herd, but he’s dead set against letting one
of his own steers desert it.”</p>

<p>Carver knew that this rule was true. Trailherds,
traveling as they did through cattle-populated
ranges, experienced a certain accretion
of numbers through the joining of curious
or lonesome cows and it was no infrequent thing
for a drove to reach the shipping point a number
of head stronger than on the start. The foremen
of trail crews were supposed to use every effort
to avoid such accretions and to work their herds
at intervals and throw out any off-brands. Many,
in order to save time and trouble, waited until
reaching the quarantine belt before cutting their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
herds. The brand owners grazing in the unowned
lands had formed the Cherokee Strip
Cattlemen’s Association, and this organization
maintained brand inspectors at the Caldwell
stockyards to guard against the possibility of
any of its members’ cows being inadvertently
shipped with droves that had been trail-herded
through their ranges.</p>

<p>“No, the trail herds don’t usually drop many
of their own steers en route,” Carver agreed.
“It’s more apt to be reversed. But the rule
holds good in Texas as well as in the Strip, so
I’ll go out and sign up a dozen or so of them,
even if the paper proves to be only a futile sort
of a document in the end.”</p>

<p>Some three weeks thereafter Carver rode with
Bart Lassiter up a scrub-oak side hill. A little
camp nestled in the draw below them where two
other men rode herd on a dozen head of steers.</p>

<p>“It appears to me like you’d staked a losing
venture,” Bart asserted, “with three riders and
a cook on your payroll and only a dozen steers in
camp. We’ve covered this whole neighborhood
thorough and yet you stay round. Why don’t we
move to some more likely piece of country, say
toward the head of the Cimarron?”</p>

<p>“But it’s so much simpler to let all those
strays have time to come down here and join us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
than by our rushing things and trying to ride
that whole big country in search of them ourselves,”
said Carver.</p>

<p>They topped the ridge and Carver pulled up
his horse behind a scrub-oak thicket. A trail
herd streamed down the far slope of the valley
and was halted in a meadow that opened out in
the timbered bottoms of Turkey Creek two miles
above Crowfoot’s ranch, the one place in the
Strip not yet deserted. Crowfoot, having beef
contracts to fill, had been permitted to retain a
number of steers on the Turkey Creek range
with the understanding that the last of the animals
was to be slaughtered and the place vacated
thirty days prior to the date scheduled for the
entry of the Unowned Lands.</p>

<p>“Just consider the amount of territory that
herd has covered,” Carver commented.</p>

<p>Bart recognized the herd as that of X I L with
his two half-brothers in charge, and, as Carver
had remarked, the drive had covered considerable
territory. It suddenly occurred to Bart that the
trail bosses whose signatures Carver had obtained
were those representing Texas brands ranging
south of the Washita or between that stream and
the Canadian, the country through which the
herd had passed. After entering the Strip it was
not Milt’s custom to follow the regular trail-herd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
routes but instead he drifted his charges slowly
down the North Fork of the Canadian, then
across to the Cimarron and down that stream.</p>

<p>“I expect strays have been joining them all
along the line,” Carver observed. “Now if
they’d just happen to work the herd right here
on Turkey Creek instead of waiting till they
reach quarantine it would be right handy for us.”</p>

<p>Bart turned and regarded him, the main purpose
of Carver’s venture now quite clear to him.
Milt would cut his herd here on Turkey Creek
and Crowfoot, having still time for one last turn
in inexpensive beef, would present him with ten
dollars for every off-brand thrown out of the
herd. Bronson, the owner of the X I L and
whose trail herd was the medium for this traffic,
probably received a like sum from Crowfoot.</p>

<p>“It’s been a nice safe occupation for a trail
boss,” Bart said. “He’s privileged to work his
herd at any point he elects. It’s even considered
the honorable thing to do if he’s willing to take
the time. If by any chance some outside party
gathers in the off-brands he’s throwed out of the
herd, it’s no fault of his.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I’d decided to gather in those off-brands
myself,” said Carver. “See how simple
it is?”</p>

<p>“Oh, quite!” said Bart. “And also if I ride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
down with you on that errand it will create a rift
in my family tree.”</p>

<p>“You once remarked to me that your family
relations had been strained before now but that
the breach had later healed,” said Carver. “This
will likely leave a permanent scar, but I’ll pay
you three dollars a head for all the off-brands we
collect down there.”</p>

<p>“I value the esteem of Milt and Noll but I’m
needing the money bad,” said Bart. “Let’s you
and me ride down.”</p>

<p>“Not right this minute,” Carver dissented.
“Let them finish working the herd. Then all
we’ll have to do is to drive off our meat.”</p>

<p>“Or it’s just possible that we’ve mapped out
quite a chore for ourselves,” said Bart. “Milt
is in charge down there. He’s easy to get along
with, mostly, but deadly as hell when he ain’t.
I’m wondering how he’ll take it.”</p>

<p>“Being a person of fair average brains, and
not a haphazard homicide like Noll, he’ll take it
easy,” Carver said. “I’m armed with a permit
from the military authorities to conduct my work
in any part of the unowned lands. I represent
half the brands that ranged in the Strip and hold
a like authority from the trail bosses of a dozen
Texas outfits.”</p>

<p>He pointed to the work in progress in the bottoms.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Riders were stationed at intervals round
the herd to hold it. Others entered and singled
out off-brands and once a trained cow-horse had
spotted the animal wanted by his rider, he followed
doggedly, never losing his prey, and when
near the edge of the herd he crowded it out with
a sudden swift rush.</p>

<p>“They’re throwing them off up the bottoms,”
Carver said. “In a few hours we’ll get Bradshaw
and saunter down. After chatting with
them for a spell we’ll mention that we’ve been
sent in by the Cattlemen’s Association. Their
hands are tied.”</p>

<p>This assumption proved correct and Milt Lassiter,
silent as always, failed even to comment
upon the matter when, some hours later, the
three men casually made known their errand and
rode off up the bottoms in search of strays.
Three days later Carver reached the stockyards
with a hundred and twelve head of steers that
wore brands of owners whom he represented.
The majority of these bore the insignia of Texas
outfits but there were some forty steers wearing
the mark of Strip owners, strays which had been
run into the herd on its way down the Cimarron.
He was cleared and given immediate shipping
facilities, for the congestion of cows in the quarantine
belt had passed, only to be replaced by an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
even greater congestion of packed humanity just
outside.</p>

<p>Thirty thousand souls had come to swell the
transient population of Caldwell. A like number
were camped along the line and Caldwell
drew their trade. Day by day the jam increased.
Incoming trains were packed and roads
converging upon the town were filled with a solid
procession of vehicles which bore families of
hopeful home seekers toward the edge of the unowned
lands. Caldwell, three months since a
little cow town of but two thousand souls, was
now doing business on the basis of a hundred
thousand population. Property prices doubled
overnight and still the swarm increased at the
rate of a thousand a day.</p>

<p>And beyond, across the dead line which held
the mob back from its goal, the cause of all this
rush and turmoil basked in peaceful serenity,
twelve thousand square miles of it, untenanted
by a single soul. The soldiers rode the line on
all four sides of it to hold the over-anxious back;
on the west there were troopers stationed at intervals
of a mile the length of the Cherokee-Texas
border, and on the south along the Oklahoma
line. To the east the Arkansas River,
separating the Strip from old Indian Territory,
was similarly patrolled; yet with all these precautions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
there were scores of sooners who had
slipped through and secreted themselves inside.
On the appointed day they would come forth
from their retreat and drive their flag on some
choice claim as the horde rushed in.</p>

<p>Late summer droughts had claimed the country
and the range was parched and brown. Registration
booths were erected along the line in the
glaring heat and as the day of entry approached
there were long strings of men, some extending
for upwards of half a mile, lined up to await their
turn for registration. They camped in the line,
sleeping where they had been standing when
night shut down and the registration booths were
closed, some reposing on bare ground, others in
campbeds which they rolled and utilized as seats
throughout the day, dragging them along as the
line progressed. Wives and daughters carried
meals to their menfolk and vendors plied the line
to peddle food and drink.</p>

<p>Every conceivable variety of business had
opened up in Caldwell to cater to the ever-increasing
throngs. It was the wildest of all
frontier booms. Carver’s profit in stray steers
had netted him something over eighteen hundred
dollars. He disposed of his business building at
a net profit of fifty-six hundred and sold out his
three lots and little house on the outskirts of town<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
for an even thousand. After clearing his indebtedness
on calves, horses and equipment he
had something over sixty-three hundred left. He
then entered into consultation with Younger and
Joe Hinman.</p>

<p>“How much would you figure the best of the
bottom land in the Strip will bring when it’s
proved up?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Not much over eight or ten dollars at the
first, maybe twelve an acre for the best of it,”
Hinman estimated.</p>

<p>“But if I live a long life I’ll see every foot
of it touch fifty,” said Carver. “Don’t you
think?”</p>

<p>“And if you live a while longer than that
you’ll see it top a hundred,” Hinman stated.
“It’ll take some time but it will get there. I’ve
seen it repeated before now as a country settles
up.”</p>

<p>“I’ve made my last bet on tumbleweeds,” said
Carver. “And I’d as soon start my pumpkin
patch down there as anywheres. It would be
right nice to have something over a thousand
acres of good land down on Cabin Creek, the old
site of the Half Diamond H.”</p>

<p>“It would,” said Younger. “Only it can’t be
done. A man can only file on a quarter section
and he has to live there to prove up. Even if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
could buy his relinquishment you couldn’t live
on but one place at once.”</p>

<p>“Last year when I went up to Kansas City in
charge of a train-load of your steers a banker
showed me a collection of scrip he’d made,” said
Carver. “It was Civil War Scrip, issued to
veterans in lieu of pensions, or maybe on top of
pensions, I don’t know which. Anyway, it entitles
the holder to lay that paper on any tract of
government land and get a patent to it without
having to live there and prove up. A number
used it on small plots left open round where they
lived and sold off the fractions left over for whatever
they could get. On and off in the last ten
years this banker has accumulated such fractions
to the amount of seventeen hundred acres. He
intimated that he’d let them go for the price of
the raw land. If he’ll sell for three dollars an
acre he’s found a customer.”</p>

<p>“But the Strip won’t be opened for entry till
a certain hour,” Hinman objected. “And right
then there’ll be three men for every claim turned
loose across the line at once.”</p>

<p>“There’s thousands making the run that don’t
consider proving up,” said Carver. “They’ll relinquish
for whatever they can get. I can furnish
them with scrip to get their patent and they can
deed it right back to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>Carver returned a week later, owner of scrip
to the extent of nearly two thousand acres. As
he stepped from the train he noted Bart and Noll
Lassiter conversing, Bart grinning as usual while
Noll’s face expressed black wrath.</p>

<p>“Noll is a trifle upset over our turn in off-brand
steers,” Bart told Carver as he joined him.
“He considers me a traitor and is deciding which
of twenty different methods will be the most
painful way to kill me. Says he’s no brother of
mine, which it’s a relief for me to discover the
fact, since I’ve always wished he wasn’t. He
seemed real irate.”</p>

<p>They turned to view a murky haze off to the
south, a haze that changed to dense billowing
black smoke as a hungry blaze licked across the
parched prairies. Some thought the soldiers had
fired the grass to drive out the sooners that
skulked in hiding in the Strip. Others averred
that the cowmen, remembering that time when
the boomers had fired the range, had waited till
this time to retaliate, a few days before the settlers
were to take over their old domain. Whatever
its source, the fact remained that in the space
of two days there were hundreds of square miles
of the unowned lands transformed into a black
and devastated waste.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Soldiers</span> sat their horses at half-mile intervals,
awaiting the appointed hour to give the
signal for the home seekers to cross the line.</p>

<p>Molly Lassiter’s eyes snapped excitedly as she
viewed the scene, a spectacle which has never
been duplicated in all history. More than a hundred
and fifty thousand souls were banked up
behind the Cherokee-Kansas line and a thinner
wave had assembled on the Oklahoma side, where
the barrier would be lowered at the same hour as
that along the northern edge.</p>

<p>“And six months ago I was thinking it would
take years to settle it,” Carver said. “There’s
twelve thousand square miles in the unowned
lands—and within four hours from the time the
pistol cracks she’ll be settled solid; every foot of
ground staked and tenanted, right down to the
last odd scrap.”</p>

<p>Bart Lassiter joined them as they rode along
behind the line. Every sort of conveyance the
West has ever seen was represented. Hundreds
of canvas-covered wagons were stationed along
the front ranks of the mob, their owners having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
camped there for days, in frequent instances for
months, to make certain of holding a place in the
forefront of the run. Buckboards and lumbering
farm wagons, top buggies and family carriages,
shining runabouts, with here and there a racing
cart, the slender, high-strung horse between the
shafts fretting restlessly for the start. Saddle
horses of every conceivable size and color. Scores
of Kentucky thoroughbreds had been shipped in
to make the run and even now, two hours before
the start, their riders were maneuvering for
favorable positions as formerly they had jockied
at the wire.</p>

<p>Individuals reacted differently to the strain of
waiting. Some genial souls called encouragement
to others and optimistically predicted that
there would be claims for all as they motioned
some anxious newcomer in the rear to some gap
nearer the front. Others glared suspiciously at
all about them and resented every shift of their
neighbors lest the movement provide space for
another hopeful soul. Many men seemed anxious
and careworn. Most of these had families and
the next few hours would mean much to them,
their every hope based upon staking out a claim.
Some feverishly discussed their chances while
others were quite stolid; many were boastful,
announcing for the benefit of all within earshot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
that they knew exactly the best piece of ground
in the Strip and would beat all others to the spot.
One woman called out hysterically to a friend
some yards away as the three riders passed behind
her,</p>

<p>“Have your man stake the claim next to
ourn,” she screeched. “Then we can neighbor
back and forth. Watch now and pull right in
behind us,” she urged, as if the start were but two
seconds off instead of as many hours. “Don’t
let any one wedge in between.”</p>

<p>There were already a half-dozen vehicles in
between and their occupants fidgeted irritably
under the constant scourge of her insistent
screech.</p>

<p>One ample soul fanned her infant while answering
the questions showered upon her by the
rest of her brood, smiling meanwhile at all who
caught her eye and occasionally dropping a word
of good cheer to the tall lean man who occupied
the seat beside her, his eyes roving moodily off
across the burned and blackened area of the
promised land. A meek little woman near by
cried quietly while her man awkwardly sought to
dissuade her, speaking gruffly in his concern over
this unforeseen situation.</p>

<p>“Close up it sounds like a flock of chattering
magpies,” said Carver. “And from a distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
it sounds like the everlasting blat of a band of
sheep. Whatever do you suppose brought all
this swarm together?”</p>

<p>“The need that every human feels,” Molly
answered. “The urge to have a home.”</p>

<p>She had pulled up her horse and Carver, following
the direction of her gaze, saw an old
couple on the seat of a wagon on the very front
of the line. The man’s beard was white and a
ragged fringe of white hair showed beneath his
battered hat; one of the pioneers who had helped
hew out homes in the West for others but who
had neglected to retain one for himself. For a
year old Judd Armstrong had been camped at
various points along the line and Caldwell had
come to know him. The little old lady beside him
was hatless, her hair drawn tightly back from her
brows and twisted in a scanty knot behind, the
blistering sun falling full upon her wrinkled,
weather-beaten face. She gazed serenely forth
upon the restless horde of humanity around her,
undisturbed by the nearness of the hour which
would determine whether at last she should have
a home after having been deprived of one for all
these many years. Life had handed her many
reverses but she had faced them all with that
same serenity, confident that old Judd would see
her through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“Is there any chance for them?” the girl
anxiously inquired.</p>

<p>Carver shook his head doubtfully as he studied
the two patient, bony horses that were destined
to carry the ancient couple into the wild scramble
of the most desperate stampede of the century.</p>

<p>“Not much, I’m fearing,” he returned. “This
will be one awful tangle, with every man for himself.
Poor old souls; they oughtn’t to go into it
with that worn-out team.”</p>

<p>He turned to Molly and she was looking up at
him, in her eyes that same expression which, at
that first meeting, had impressed him with the
thought that she was in grave need of something.</p>

<p>“Don’t look at me like that, Honey,” he said.
“Not with folks looking on. I might lose my
head and forget there was any one around.
Maybe they’ll find a scrap of ground that the
rest have run over without noticing. We’ll hope
it transpires that way, won’t we?”</p>

<p>She nodded without speaking and they rode
on down the line. A little knot of horsemen appeared
some distance out across the blackened
landscape, their progress marked by puffs of fine
black ashes and tossed aloft by their horses’
hoofs.</p>

<p>“Cavalry patrol bringing out some sooner
they’ve picked up,” Carver stated, as he watched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
the group approach. “There’s likely two hundred
odd hiding out down there to take their pick
of the claims when the run sets in.”</p>

<p>All through the preceding night there had
been irregular spurts of rifle shots at various
points along the line as troopers opened up on
sooners that had watched their chance to slip
through the cordon of guards and make a run
for it.</p>

<p>“Did you hear the shooting last night?” she
asked, and Carver nodded.</p>

<p>“Tumbleweeds drifting through,” he said.
“Most of them urged on just for the love of
taking chances—others on the chance of making
a few dollars by selling out.”</p>

<p>“Are there many like that?” she asked. “I
mean ones who are doing it for the sake of a few
dollars instead of with the idea of living on their
claims.”</p>

<p>“Thousands,” Carver testified. “Every
puncher that ever rode in the Strip will stake a
claim and there’s not one out of ten that would
live on the place a week. Most of them are going
in for the sport of making the run.”</p>

<p>“And they’ll stake the best tracts,” she said.</p>

<p>“They will,” Carver agreed. “They know
the country and are equipped to get there first.
But there’s such a scattering few compared to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the size of the country that their filings all combined
won’t make a pin-prick on the map.”</p>

<p>“And where will you file?” she inquired.</p>

<p>“The Half Diamond H,” he said. “That’s
my destination. Every ranch down there stands
just as she was left when the cowmen vacated the
Strip. Owners are privileged to move their improvements
off but they’re mostly sod buildings.
The parties filing on them will be saved the trouble
and expense of erecting new sod huts.”</p>

<p>“But there’s a frame house on the Half Diamond
H,” she said.</p>

<p>“Four rooms—the only one in this end of the
Strip,” he returned. “Old Nate said he couldn’t
move it off with any profit and that whoever
staked it wouldn’t likely offer any sum to speak
of, so it was mine if only I’d stake the place
myself.”</p>

<p>“But won’t all the boys that used to ride that
country be heading for that same spot?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“The old home-ranch sites will be the plums,”
he admitted. “They’re located in good country
and all the peelers will line out for them. If one
of the boys beats me to it, I’ll give him a hundred
to move on and stake the next. The Half
Diamond H sets in twenty sections of rich bottom
land in the Cabin Creek valley. There’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
likely be thirty or more old friends of mine head
right into that bottom to file, and I can buy the
big part of them out. They’ll sell to the first
man who appears and puts in a bid. That will
be me.”</p>

<p>“You’ve found one customer now,” Bart announced.
“You can buy me out cheap.”</p>

<p>“Pick your places in the line and hold them,”
Molly urged. “You’ll have a bad start otherwise.”</p>

<p>“Plenty of time,” Carver said. “We couldn’t
get into the front rank or anywhere near it, so
I’d as soon start from behind. A fifty-yard
handicap won’t matter much in a long pull.
Those thoroughbreds will stretch out in the lead
for the first couple of miles and give their riders
a chance to stake, but they wouldn’t last on a
long hard drag. One of them would run my
horse off his feet in the first three miles and mine
would kill him off in the next ten or twelve. You
notice the boys aren’t much concerned over
places,” and he motioned toward an irregular
string of riders well back of the congested throng
banked up along the Cherokee-Kansas line.</p>

<p>All the old-time cowhands of the Strip were
prowling here and there, inspecting those who
were so soon to swarm in and take over their old
stamping ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>The crowd tightened as the hour approached,
squeezing a few feet toward the front as if every
inch in the direction of their goal would count for
much in the final frenzied spurt of the get-away.
Carver looked at his watch and snapped it shut.</p>

<p>“Five minutes,” he announced. “You follow
along to the Half Diamond H if you lose us,
Molly. I’ve got a food cache there.”</p>

<p>They pulled up their horses, having returned
to the point of their original stand. Judd Armstrong
seemed never to have shifted in his seat
and the emaciated horses drooped contentedly,
unmindful of the sudden tenseness that gripped
all those around. The more high-strung horses
sensed it and fidgeted nervously. The ample
soul still mothered her infant and smiled while
her man sat as stolidly as before, gazing somberly
out across the blackened waste that stretched out
ahead. The troopers had ceased patrolling the
line and now sat their horses at half-mile intervals
and faced the eager horde they had held in
check for so long a time. The hysterical lady cut
short a screech of advice to her neighbor four rigs
away as the strains of a bugle sounded faintly
from afar, penetrating the buzz of conversation
and silencing it. A second note, far to the westward,
joined the first and in a space of two seconds
the clear ringing strains of the bugles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
pealed the same message along a front of two
hundred miles.</p>

<p>There was a sudden tense hush, the troopers
sitting rigidly in their saddles. As the last notes
died away each soldier fired a single shot, and
with a tremendous sullen roar the most spectacular
run of all time was off to a running start.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A slender</span> thoroughbred leaped forward with
the shots, his rider crouched low along his neck.
Carver had a brief glimpse of hundreds of saddle
horses fanning ahead of the main bulk of the
stampede. Then his view was cut off by the
dense fog of black ashes churned aloft.</p>

<p>“Look!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>In either direction, as far as the eye could
reach this murky cloud was sweeping forward.
As it eddied and curled he could catch glimpses
of the swaying gray tops of covered wagons and
the glittering flash of newly painted runabouts.
It seemed that a black cyclone belt a hundred
yards in width had sucked up thousands of
strange land craft and churned them across the
prairies over an endless front.</p>

<p>Men shouted frenzied encouragement to their
horses, their voices lifting above the rattle
of the laboring vehicles. Not infrequently there
sounded a splintering crash as some outfit was
piled up in a wreck or the sudden smash and subsequent
groaning screech which announced that
two rival wagons had collided and locked hubs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
A shrill cowboy yelp of exultation rose high
above the uproar.</p>

<p>“Now we can break through,” Carver stated,
and they urged their horses into a lope and
passed the wagons that lagged behind, darting
past others as opportunity offered.</p>

<p>The girl saw humanity in the raw, the bars of
convention lowered by excitement and each
man’s true nature standing forth undisguised.
She was treated to kaleidoscopic flashes of human
avarice and sublime generosity. A heavy
wagon came to grief as its owner lashed his horses
over the four-foot bank of a dry wash. The
tongue was stabbed into the earth, buckled and
snapped, piling the outfit up in a tangled heap in
the bottom of the dry gulch. A man in a light
rig cheered the accident as he made a safe crossing
of the wash at a point some few feet away where
the banks were less precipitate, shrieking a derisive
farewell to the unfortunates as he passed.
A chap-clad rider set his horse back on its
haunches and dismounted.</p>

<p>“Crawl him, stranger,” he invited. “Give
that pony his head and he’ll take you where
you’re aiming for. I’ll help the woman straighten
out this tangle.”</p>

<p>The man boarded the horse and darted off,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
leaving the cowboy to care for his wife and children
and the struggling team.</p>

<p>Just beyond the wreck a man had leaped from
a wagon to plant his flag while his wife held the
horses. A single man had unloaded from a
runabout with similar intent and as the girl
passed them the two were fighting savagely, endeavoring
through the medium of physical combat
to settle the question as to which one had first
placed foot upon the ground. While the wife
and family of the one gazed upon the scene from
the wagon, the horse of the other was running
away with the runabout which was lurching perilously
across the dips and sways of the prairie.</p>

<p>They passed old Judd Armstrong, his bony
horses surging on at an awkward gallop. The
little old lady gripped a staff topped by a white
scrap of cloth with which she intended to flag the
first scrap of ground they crossed where she
could see no others out ahead. But always there
was a swarm of scurrying shapes far out in the
lead.</p>

<p>Just as Carver pulled out ahead of the last
fringe of wheeled conveyances the girl heard
again the shrill exultant cowboy yelp and saw the
man riding just ahead of them. He was a big
fellow with a week-old growth of beard, mounted
on a rangy bay horse that wore a Texas brand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
He had given the animal its head and was half-turned
in the saddle, looking back at the sea of
lurching, swaying vehicles. His mouth was extended
in a grin and he waved his gun aloft.</p>

<p>“Charge!” he bellowed. “Charge!”</p>

<p>He emptied his gun in the air and waved them
on as if he were leading the line into some desperate
affray. He bawled facetious commands
to all within earshot. His noisy clamor reminded
the girl of Noll, and she hated the big Texan
from the instant her mind conceived this fancied
resemblance. She herself read the pathos that
was written in every movement of the mad
scramble, the hungry rush of the homeless; and
she told herself that the noisy horseman viewed it
in the light of a screaming comedy.</p>

<p>A wave of ground cut off her view toward the
east, but as the slight crest flattened to merge
gradually with the surrounding prairie the objects
on the far side reappeared, at first merely
the heads and shoulders of those who traveled a
parallel course, then their bodies, then the mounts
that carried them. One form seemed to progress
smoothly but there was a queer crouch to the
head and shoulders. As more of him rose into
her level of vision, she saw that he rode an antiquated
bicycle with one huge wheel in front and
a tiny one trailing in its wake. The man was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
hunched over the handle bars and was pedalling
desperately, a grotesque figure with coattails
streaming out behind, a water bottle slung across
his back with the shaft of a small flag thrust
through the strap.</p>

<p>“Oh, Don! Bart! Do look,” Molly implored.
She was laughing in sheer delight yet she was
conscious of a swift, hot resentment when the
big Texan raised his voice in a joyous whoop as
he sighted the strange apparition and gave chase.
He veered his mount to the left, unbuckling his
rope strap, and as the animal stretched into a full
run behind the speeding cyclist he shook out a
few coils of his rope and whirled his loop aloft.
He did not make his throw but contented himself
with giving voice to a wild yelp with every jump
of his horse. His victim turned to cast an apprehensive
glance over his shoulder and the front
wheel collided with a dog mound and threw him.
Even in the act of rising he thrust his flag into
the ground and staked his claim, the big fellow
cheering him as he passed.</p>

<p>Hundreds of riders were scattered out in the
lead of the line of oncoming vehicles that was
strung out as far as the girl could see toward the
east and west. Whenever one horseman attained
the lead in his own particular section of the field
he flung from the saddle and planted his flag.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Scattered at intervals through it all Molly could
make out moving specks of color—bright reds
and purples, brilliant orange and softer effects
of lavender—and she knew these for the gaudy
regalia of the cowboys. These were not dismounting
but riding steadily ahead, each with
some particular destination in mind, saving their
horses for the last wild spurt. Little by little the
field thinned out. Some few of the cowmen had
dashed suddenly ahead to stake their claims in
some of the better valleys but the majority of
them were still holding on. They swept down
into a wide brown valley untouched by the fire
and three times during the crossing of it Molly
saw riders dismount far ahead—too far; and
she knew that these were sooners who had been
hiding in the unowned lands and who had now
put in an appearance as the peak of the run came
in sight.</p>

<p>The Texan had lost ground in his chase of the
cyclist but eventually Molly heard him off to the
right and rear, his big voice raised in a song
which she thought fitted him exactly.</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>When they had covered some ten miles Molly
noted that the brilliant specks were forging
steadily forward through the scattered ranks of
their more somberly clad fellows and gradually
attaining the very fore fringe of the run. Another
two miles and the bright dots were out in
the lead and it was apparent that many were converging
upon the line which Carver followed
toward a distant dip in the landscape. Every
cowhand was up on a horse that had proved its
speed and endurance in many a hard round-up
circle. The clatter and crash of vehicles had died
out behind. Carver glanced both ways along the
line.</p>

<p>“The boys are drawing in toward the Cabin
Creek bottoms,” he called to Molly. “Best land
in the Strip. There’ll be many a friend of mine
in the lot. Here’s hoping they stake near the old
home ranch.”</p>

<p>He glanced along the scattered line again as
they rode across a low wave of the prairie and the
broad bottoms of Cabin Creek opened out below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
them, spared by the fire and carpeted with grass
that was only now turning brown.</p>

<p>“Now!” he said. “Run for it!” and they let
their horses out and raced down the gentle pitch.</p>

<p>Carver kept his eye on the low point of a ridge
that thrust its nose into the edge of the valley
three miles below. Just beyond that shoulder
the Curl Fork of Cabin Creek joined in and the
buildings of the Half Diamond H nestled under
the hill. Below that point the bottoms widened
out to twice the width of the part they now
traversed. More than thirty riders were strung
out across the level floor of the valley, careening
down both sides of the creek.</p>

<p>Some dropped from the saddle and drove their
flags, but a dozen or more on Carver’s side of the
creek held straight on. This last spurt was a contest
between seasoned riders and tried horses.
Carver urged his mount and the animal drew on
his last reserve of speed. Molly felt the smooth
play of powerful muscle sweeping her on toward
the goal as her own horse, fresher from having
carried less weight over the long miles, ran nose
to nose with Carver’s. Bart was twenty feet to
their left and as far in the rear.</p>

<p>As they thundered down upon a tiny spring-creek
flowing on the near side of the shoulder
Carver waved a hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“Up there!” he shouted to Bart. “Flag it!”</p>

<p>Bart whirled up the course of the spring-creek
and the girl wheeled her horse to follow him while
Carver held the straight course for the low jutting
point. As Bart and Molly turned aside, the
big Texan dropped from his horse a hundred
yards down the little stream and planted his flag.</p>

<p>A dozen riders were almost abreast of Carver
as he rounded the point and flung from his saddle
in the ranch yard of the Half Diamond H. He
had staked the old home ranch.</p>

<p>He turned to watch the rest flash past and
recognized a big paint horse as a circle mount of
Bradshaw’s string. The group that had clung
so persistently instead of staking farther up the
valley was composed of old friends to a man. He
picked them one by one as they fanned out
through the widening bottoms and staked them
from the creek to the valley slope for two solid
miles below the Half Diamond H.</p>

<p>“Box T riders or former Half Diamond
hands,” he said. “Every man. I needn’t have
put on such a strenuous last spurt if I’d only
looked back to see who made up the bunch that
was crowding me so hard on the final lap. I see
old Joe Hinman’s hand in this.”</p>

<p>He turned at a sound behind him. A man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
stood calmly by a lathered horse some thirty
yards back among the sod outbuildings.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to get off,” the stranger announced.
“This is my ground. I staked it
first.”</p>

<p>Carver stared for a brief space, unable to
grasp the fact that another had rounded the
point ahead of him. He certainly had not arrived
since Carver reached the spot so he must
have been there first. Then Carver’s comprehension
cleared and he led his horse back toward
the other.</p>

<p>“Looks like you had beat me here for a fact,”
he said.</p>

<p>“By three minutes,” the stranger stated.</p>

<p>Carver glanced at the man’s horse. The animal’s
shoulders and flanks were lathered white,
as if from a long hard run, but its breathing was
smooth and regular and its sides were steady.
He glanced at his own mount with its heaving
flanks; listened to the animal’s heavy labored
breathing.</p>

<p>“Beat you by three minutes,” the stranger
reasserted.</p>

<p>Carver touched the lathered horse with one
forefinger, carried the member to his mouth, then
spat the soapsuds out.</p>

<p>“Yes, you beat me by three days,” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
“Which is just a shade too broad a margin.
Now you step up into the middle of that pony,
and start working up a real sweat on him while
you’re getting away from here.”</p>

<p>The sooner faced him defiantly, a black scowl
on his countenance, but he read the same purpose
in Carver’s eyes that Freel had discovered in
them on the day the marshal had offered to make
Molly Lassiter respectable.</p>

<p>“I’ll sell out for five hundred,” he offered.</p>

<p>“In less than that many seconds you’ll be
headed for some place where money can’t follow
you,” Carver returned evenly. “You climb that
horse and amble.”</p>

<p>The sooner swung to the saddle and rode off
toward the eastern slope of the valley. It would
have availed him little to head down country, for
already the bottoms were filled with riders.
Those left behind in the last mad dash for the
Half Diamond H were now pouring through in
hundreds. The side hills that flanked the western
edge of the valley were being staked and
other riders streamed along their crests.</p>

<p>When Carver looked again he saw that the
sooner had planted his flag a half-mile up the
little spring-creek that trickled past the doors of
the ranch house and on down to the parent
stream, a mate for the one that flowed on the far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
side of the ridge where he had sent Bart Lassiter.
The sooner’s present holding would be just
across the ridge from Bart. But Carver was not
concerned over the future actions of the man. If
he succeeded in holding a piece of ground which
should have gone to some legitimate stampeder
it was no affair of his, Carver reflected, and dismissed
it from his mind. For thirty minutes the
home seekers continued to pour through in
gradually diminishing numbers. Most of the
wheeled conveyances had dropped out, their
owners either having won their goal at some
point farther back or given up the race, but a few
buckboards rattled past in the wake of the last
straggling horseman.</p>

<p>Then Carver turned to the work in hand.
Those in his immediate vicinity who had made
the run for the purpose of realizing a quick turn
on their relinquishments were the ones he sought.
The cowhands were the logical parties to interview.</p>

<p>Bradshaw was sprawled comfortably on the
ground on the next quarter section below.</p>

<p>“Old Joe is responsible for this,” Carver said,
as he rode down toward his friend. “He sorted
out the Box T boys that were going to make a
filing just to sell it, and such of the old Half
Diamond H boys as he could locate. This way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
it helps us all. They find me a ready buyer and
I find them ready sellers, roosting on the very
ground I want. Then, too, Joe was thinking of
old Nate. Younger lived here for twenty years.
With me on the Half Diamond H he can come
down and find at least a part of it the same.”</p>

<p>Bradshaw grinned as Carver neared him.</p>

<p>“What’s your offer?” he demanded. “Speak
in big figures now or I’ll stay here and farm this
piece myself. Joe tipped us off to swarm in and
settle in a flock just below Nate’s old home ranch.
Well, what do you bid?”</p>

<p>“Two hundred and fifty,” Carver stated.</p>

<p>“Too much—but I’ll take it,” said Bradshaw.
“Give me a commission and I’ll buy the
others out for you anywheres from fifty to a
hundred.”</p>

<p>“Two hundred and fifty is my flat price to
every man,” said Carver. “That’s a good fair
figure for both sides. They’ll have to take my
notes for it, dated eighteen months ahead at six
per cent. They can either wait and live off the
interest meantime or discount them at the bank—provided
they can locate a banker who’s optimistic
enough to make an investment in my
paper.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ride along with you to see the others,”
Bradshaw volunteered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“You all can go and make your filings in the
next few days,” Carver said. “Then I’ll furnish
each of you with scrip to lay on your quarter.
You can deed it over to me when you get your
patent.”</p>

<p>Two hours later Carver rode across the low
ridge in search of Molly Lassiter.</p>

<p>“Ever see a prettier nook than this?” he
asked, as he dismounted. “I told Bart I had
just the place picked out for you and him.”</p>

<p>A few trees, somewhat gnarled and stunted—but
every such growth is noteworthy in a treeless
country, and the black-jack belt did not extend
so far north as this—sprouted in a little dent in
the base of the ridge, a level floor of rich ground
spread out before them. The little creek, fed by
side-hill springs, purred merrily along the foot of
the slope.</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful here,” she agreed. “I’d love
it if only Bart would stay here and prove up instead
of selling out.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we can exert a little pressure and
make Bart come to his milk,” said Carver. “This
is too good a place to sell out offhand. Wait till
I scour a few layers of ashes off my face and
we’ll ride up to the ridge so you can see my
layout.”</p>

<p>His face was still black from the ride across<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the burned areas and he repaired to the little
creek and splashed face and hands in the clear
cold water. The big Texan had come part way
up the creek to converse with Bart and his voice
carried to Carver as he made boastful comments
upon his own farsightedness.</p>

<p>“I don’t know this country but I staked as
good a piece as there is in the whole twelve thousand
miles. That’s me! Know how? I’ll follow
the leather-legs, I decides; the peelers that has
rode this stretch. They’ll know where the best
ground is. I’ll trail along and be there, for there
ain’t no man can outride me when I’m up on this
bay horse.”</p>

<p>His voice followed them as Carver and Molly
rode up the gentle slope of the ridge and the girl
hoped she would not have this man as a neighbor
for long. His bluster made her feel that Noll
was near at hand. There had been a clean break
in their relations since Carver’s recent turn in
inexpensive beef, and Noll had asserted that
Bart was no relative of his. If only he could
convince others of that, she reflected, she would
be far better satisfied.</p>

<p>“See,” Carver said, pointing as they topped
the ridge. “I’ve bargained for eleven quarters
besides my own. That gives me eighteen hundred
acres in one block. I’ll leave that first piece<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
in front of the house in grass, just like it is now.
Then when old Nate comes down to visit round
with me it will seem almost like the same old place
he’s lived in for the past twenty years or more.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad, Don,” she said. “But how can
you be sure they’ll deed the land over to you
after they get their patents. There’s no possible
way to pin a man down to turn over his homestead
to another.”</p>

<p>“Not a way in the world,” he conceded.
“They could keep their place or sell it, once the
patent’s issued, and I couldn’t lift a hand. I’d
counted on losing maybe a quarter or two that
very way. But not now; not with those Box T
and Half Diamond H boys on the other end of it.
Wouldn’t one of ’em throw me if he was offered
ten times the price.”</p>

<p>She hoped that he had gauged them rightly
but her experience had taught her to doubt this
class of drifting, homeless men. She had met a
number of such during the last few years of
drifting with Bart, mainly the associates of the
two elder half-brothers, and she had come to believe
that trustworthiness was an infrequent trait
among their kind.</p>

<p>Bart mounted the ridge and joined them.</p>

<p>“What’s offered for my farm?” he greeted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“I’m not buying on the far side of the ridge,”
said Carver. “Only down below.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll present it to you,” Bart returned
cheerfully. “By the way, you’re owing me three
hundred or thereabouts on our little flier in steers.
If you could let me have a piece of it I’ll trickle
into Caldwell in the morning. I’ve got pressing
business there in town.”</p>

<p>“I’ve invested that money for you,” Carver
said. “I’ve reserved scrip to cover your hundred
and sixty acres. I’ll turn it over to you when you
make your filing. They’ll issue a patent and
then you and Molly will have some place to come
back to whenever you get weary of moving
round. You’ll be owing me a little extra on the
cost of the scrip but you can pay it off whenever
it comes handy in the future.”</p>

<p>Bart sighed gustily.</p>

<p>“I always did lean towards owning a farm
that I didn’t have to live on,” he stated, “and
you’ve showed me the way. You always did
treat me all right, Don, and I thank you. As
long as I already owe you money I’d as leave owe
you more. I’ll remember it better that way.
Lend me twenty. I suspect the boys will be
looking at their hole cards somewhat in your
bunk house this evening and I’m always curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
to see which one of the fifty-two cards each man
has got in the hole.”</p>

<p>Carver laughed and handed him the money.</p>

<p>“We’ll turn the house over to Molly to-night,”
he said. “I’ve got a tent cached in the bunk
house that you can pitch over there on your
place to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The girl rested her hand on Carver’s arm as
Bart left them.</p>

<p>“That was a wonderful thing to do for Bart,”
she said. “Oh, Don! Don’t you suppose he’ll
stay there and keep it?”</p>

<p>“Sure, Honey,” Carver assured her. “You
can’t clamp down on a range colt too sudden and
put him on the picket. We’ll keep an eye on
him and gradually decrease his range. Don’t you
fret about Bart.”</p>

<p>He was peering off across the country and
she followed the direction of his gaze. A wagon
had just crawled into view on the ridge on the
far side of Bart’s filing and near the upper edge
of it. The last rays of the setting sun caught
the tattered canvas top. Even at a distance of
three quarters of a mile both Carver and the
girl recognized the outfit as old Judd Armstrong’s,
the horses moving slowly, their heads
drooping dejectedly.</p>

<p>“You wait here, Molly,” Carver said. “I’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
ride over and help them pick a good place to
camp. Then we’ll stir up a bite for the boys to
eat.”</p>

<p>He intercepted the outfit as it pulled into the
bottoms. The little old lady still clasped the
staff of her flag.</p>

<p>“Staked your piece yet, Uncle?” Carver
greeted.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said old Judd. “We’ll likely
locate one to-morrow. These horses is about
played out and we’ll have to make camp here,
I reckon.”</p>

<p>The woman nodded serene agreement. Ever
since she could remember they had been making
camp.</p>

<p>“Maybe they can make one more drag of it
over this next rise,” Carver said. “It’s not
much of a pull. There’s a nice little creek over
across and a ripping good piece of ground that
hasn’t been staked. They all run clear on acrost
it and never noticed. It’s the next piece up the
creek from mine.”</p>

<p>He uncoiled his rope and made it fast to the
wagon tongue, took a short snub on his saddle
horn and pulled in ahead of Judd’s weary team.
The horse buckled sturdily to his task and they
made the crossing.</p>

<p>“You make camp right here on this creek,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
Carver instructed. “This is your claim. I’ll
see you to-morrow, Aunty.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, son,” she said. “You’ve done
us a big favor. This is better ground than any
we’ve crossed through. I was beginning to be
just a mite worried for fear we mightn’t find a
piece. It was real nice of you to tell us.”</p>

<p>Carver turned his horse up towards where the
sooner reclined on the creek bank.</p>

<p>“I instructed you to high-tail it out of the
country,” he announced. “So you put forth
from here sudden.”</p>

<p>“Do you imagine you’re in charge of this
whole territory?” the man demanded.</p>

<p>“I was once,” said Carver. “Foreman of the
old Half Diamond H. In lack of any better
authority I’ve elected myself temporary head of
the district so I can choose my own neighbors.
I don’t pick you.”</p>

<p>He handed the man a ten-dollar bill.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to see your efforts wasted but maybe
you can drown your grief in that,” he said.
“There’s not a chance in the world for you to
make your claim stick—and I’ll see that you
come to a bad end if you try to file. You can
use your own judgment about when you flit
from these parts.”</p>

<p>He turned back toward Molly but the girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
had gone down her own side of the ridge as a
second wagon rolled into the bottoms and halted
on the upper end of the Texan’s filing. The outfit
of the ample soul and her solemn spouse had
been wrecked in the early stages of the run and
the repairs had required too great a time to permit
of their overtaking the other stampeders. As
Molly joined them she heard the voice of the
Texan lifted in his war song as he returned from
a boastful visit with some near-by homesteader.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">“I’m a wild, wild rider</div>
<div class="verse">And an awful mean fighter——”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The song ceased abruptly as he spied the
wagon on his claim and headed his mount for the
spot. He leaned from his saddle and inspected
the ample lady who still smiled through the
grotesque mask of black ashes that had settled
on her face, then let his eyes rove over the
children in the depths of the wagon.</p>

<p>“This your claim?” the solemn man inquired.
“We just want to wash up a bit and camp here
for the night.”</p>

<p>Molly waited for the abrupt refusal. The
Texan gazed helplessly from one to another of
the group.</p>

<p>“Mean to say you didn’t get a piece of your
own with all this stretch to choose from?” he
demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>The man shook his head.</p>

<p>“Have this one,” the Texan invited. “I’ve
been wondering what the hell I’d do with it.”</p>

<p>The woman still smiled but a tear squeezed
through and trickled down, leaving a trail in the
grime of ashes on her face. She leaned over the
infant in her arms to hide the evidence of weakness,
speaking a word to the child. The Texan
shifted uneasily in the saddle and Molly saw him
in a new guise; not as a big ruffian but as an overgrown,
kindly boy, helpless to extricate himself
from this trying situation. A happy thought
struck him.</p>

<p>“I’d cry too if I thought I had to live here,”
he said. “I’d trade this whole damn country
for a square rod in Texas,” and he headed his
horse back down the creek.</p>

<p>Hours later Molly Lassiter reclined on Carver’s
camp bed which he had spread for her on
the floor of the Half Diamond H ranch house.</p>

<p>The Cherokee Run was over. At noon there
had been a vast tract of virgin territory, twelve
thousand square miles of untenanted lands,—and
within four hours of that first bugle call it
had been settled, staked to the last square inch.
The wildest stampede that the world had ever
seen was a matter of history.</p>

<p>A variety of sounds floated through the open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
window. The long, many-roomed bunk house in
rear of the frame building was crowded to overflowing.
All the cowhands for miles around had
followed the old custom of dropping in at the
nearest ranch when caught out on the range at
night, certain of finding a welcome and a feed.
They had feasted unreservedly upon Carver’s
food cache which he had planted at the ranch
weeks before.</p>

<p>Molly heard two voices raised in the chant of
the tumbleweeds as two belated riders approached.
Always these men sang when they
rode at night, having acquired the habit on many
a weary circuit of the herd, singing to quiet their
charges on the bed ground.</p>

<p>The big Texan’s voice carried to her from the
bunk house.</p>

<p>“Now when I play poker with strangers I first
state the rules,” he announced. “The way stud
poker is dealt is to hand out the top card first and
the next one next, and so on down to the bottom
card which comes off last and is not to be removed
prior to its turn.”</p>

<p>“It’s nice to have some one who actually knows
how the rules run,” another voice answered. “If
any little squabble crops up we won’t have to
debate the question but just ask you and find
out for sure.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“I’ll settle all arguments,” the Texan volunteered.
“You’ll note that I’ve stuck my knife
here in the table and I’ll certainly remonstrate
with the first party that introduces any irregularities.”</p>

<p>The two newcomers rode into the yard, unsaddled
and turned their horses into the corral. One
of them answered the questions regarding his
claim as he appeared in the door of the bunk
house.</p>

<p>“I quit it,” he announced. “A wagon came
dragging along an hour ago with a wild woman
aboard. Leastways she was talking wild—and
frequent. They’d locked hubs and piled up on
the start. I presented them my place. I hadn’t
no use for it. All my life it’s been all I could
do to scratch a living off the face of the whole outdoors,
so there wasn’t a chance for me to scrape a
income off one little quarter section anyway.”</p>

<p>“I had the piece next to his,” the second cowboy
stated. “But the other set of locked hubs
came dangling along. The woman ahead would
screech back that the tangle was all her fault from
keeping too close, and wouldn’t the other party
be sure to stake the next piece to theirs so’s they
could neighbor back and forth. Just to quiet her
down I handed mine to the parties she was so hell-bent
to neighbor with. I was afraid she’d have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
headache in the morning if she kept at it; and
besides I couldn’t lay out there and listen to that
gabble.”</p>

<p>Molly burrowed her face deep in the pillow.
During the day she had seen much that was gold
beneath that rusty exterior of the tumbleweeds
and much that was dross beneath the golden surface
of many of the pumpkins. These men who
rallied to Carver, drifters all, were a different
breed of drifters than those she had met as friends
of her two half-brothers. And now the tumbleweeds
had been cast out of their domain.</p>

<p>“Hand me them cards,” said the big Texan.
“Now we’ll have an honest deal. I’d trust myself
further than any other man I ever met.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">IX</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Carver</span> looked from the window of the Half
Diamond H. All down the valley were twinkling
lights which denoted the presence of the
homes of early-rising settlers. Off to the east
and west there were lights resting at higher levels,
these from cabins on side-hill claims on the rising
flanks of the valley. As the morning glow
flooded across the country the lights paled and
the habitations themselves appeared, first as
darker blots emerging gradually from the surrounding
obscurity, then in distinct outline as the
shadows lifted. Some were tiny frame cabins,
the most of them unpainted. The greater number
were sod huts, some few merely dugouts.
Poor habitations these, no doubt, yet they were
homes and as circumstances permitted they would
be replaced by more pretentious ones.</p>

<p>The virgin stretches of the Cherokee lands had
been transformed into a solid agricultural community
overnight. The run was not quite two
months past, yet even the style of expression, the
customs of speech and the topic of general conversation
had experienced an alteration as decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
as the physical changes in the countryside.
No more the heated arguments over the relative
merits of two cow horses but instead a less spirited
discussion concerning the desirability of
Berkshires over Durco-Jerseys. The never-ending
controversy as to the superiority of the
center-fire as against the three-quarters’ rig had
been supplanted by an interchange of advice as
to the seeding of crops and the proper care of
hogs. Where but a few weeks back the bronc
fighters had met to exchange bits of range gossip,
housewives now visited back and forth to exchange
recipes for making jell.</p>

<p>Conditions had favored late plowing, a fortunate
circumstance in view of the late date of the
opening, and a part of the settlers had made
every effort to seed a certain acreage to winter
wheat. Carver had not wasted a day in his endeavor
to get a portion of his holdings broken
out and in shape to produce the following season.
Circumstances had favored him. Cash was a rare
commodity among the majority of the homesteaders
and in lieu of it they frequently effected
an exchange of work. The spirit of coöperation
was large. Homesteads must be fenced and
materials were expensive. Many could not afford
such a drain upon their finances until such time
as they could harvest a crop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>Carver had supplied needy neighbors with
posts and wire from the great store he had salvaged
from the line fences of the old Half Diamond
H, requiring of each man in return that he
should start at once upon the task of plowing,
harrowing and drilling in winter wheat on a certain
specified acreage of Carver’s holdings. Most
of the settlers had implements of a sort. All had
plows, some few possessed drills, and what one
man lacked he borrowed from his neighbor, the
favor to be later returned in like service or in
labor when occasion should offer and so all were
enabled to perform the tasks which Carver required
of them in return for their fencing. He
now had eight hundred acres seeded to winter
wheat, planted somewhat later than was customary
but with an even chance of making a crop.</p>

<p>The transformation of the unowned lands had
been sweeping and complete. One now rode between
fences along section lines that would soon
became graded highways. Towns were springing
up with mushroom suddenness and country
schoolhouses were in the course of construction
at many points. A picture of rural activity
stretched away on all sides, yet through it all a
vague whisper of unrest persisted, as if the spirit
of the old days refused to be cast off so entirely.</p>

<p>The cowhands who had ridden the Strip continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
to ride it. Always there had been a surplus
of riders during the winter months and these
jobless ones had grub-lined from one ranch to
the next, certain of finding a welcome and a meal
at any spot where circumstance or fancy led
them. They continued to act upon this supposition,
sanctioned by long years of custom, and the
settlers looked with disfavor upon these rovers
who dropped in at their cabins and expected to
be fed as a matter of course, deeming them parasites
upon the community, drones who were unwilling
to work and produce; for the cowhands
scornfully refused to milk or follow a plow in
return for their board. From the first they had
swarmed in upon Carver, overjoyed at finding
one man of their own sort among all this clutter
of aliens,—one man who understood.</p>

<p>Carver had fed all comers, knowing that while
they would neither milk nor plow, they would
willingly turn their hands to any task which had
been part of their regular duties with a cow outfit
in the old range days. They had stretched
every foot of his fences. When there was freighting
to be done there were always willing volunteers.
Some he had sent north to Hinman’s
range to bring back the fifty head of horses he had
purchased before the opening. The boys had
gentled these green colts and taught them the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
feel of harness. Always there were a dozen grub-liners
stopping at the bunk house overnight.
Every evening Carver recited the tasks of the following
day and the men apportioned these chores
among themselves through the medium of freeze-out
poker. Carver had never cooked a meal or
washed a dish since the day of the run.</p>

<p>He now thrust his head from the back door.</p>

<p>“Ho!” he called. “Roll out!”</p>

<p>There were sounds of instant activity from the
bunk house.</p>

<p>Carver tapped on a door in the ranch house.</p>

<p>“Coming, son,” Nate Younger answered.
“Be with you right off.”</p>

<p>The original owner of the Half Diamond H
had come down to view it under the new conditions.
He had found his old room fitted up in
much the same fashion as when he had occupied
it in the past. A hundred acres of grassland, untouched
by the plow, spread out before the house.</p>

<p>“Don’t find things so much changed right in
the immediate foreground, do you, Nate?” Carver
asked.</p>

<p>“Not much,” said Nate. “Looks pretty much
the same. It is real white of you to reserve the
old man’s room for him.”</p>

<p>He listened to the drone of voices from the
bunk house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>“Must be considerable of a drain on your
finances to feed all the grub-liners these days,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Somewhat,” Carver admitted. “But I someway
can’t gather courage to shut them off. Half
of them are still conversing about when work
opens up in the spring, same as they’ve always
talked in winters. They don’t realize yet that
spring work won’t ever open up for their sort
again.”</p>

<p>After breakfasting Carver rode up the trail
that threaded the low saddle in the ridge back
of the house and dropped down to the Lassiters’
claim on the far side of it. Bart, fired by the example
of those around him, had worked steadily
since the day of the run. Cowhands stopping at
Carver’s place had helped Bart fence his claim.
With two of Carver’s teams he had broken out a
forty-acre piece and seeded it to winter wheat.
Through the medium of the nightly poker game
in the bunk house of the Half Diamond H he had
accumulated enough cash to purchase the materials
for the construction of a three-room frame
house to supplement the sod hut in which he and
Molly had been living since the run. But now his
enthusiasm had waned and Carver found him
seated on a pile of new lumber, gazing moodily
off across the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“I’m needing relaxation bad,” Bart greeted.
“Why, I wouldn’t be able to find my way around
Caldwell, it’s been that long since I’ve been in
town. Isn’t it about time you’re getting that
hundred head of yearlings off Hinman’s range
and bringing them down here?”</p>

<p>“In a few days now,” Carver admitted. “I’ll
be starting up after them before long.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you send me?” Bart suggested.</p>

<p>“With you in charge they might increase too
fast on the homeward way,” said Carver.</p>

<p>“I’ll guarantee not to arrive with one extra
head over the specified number,” Bart offered.
“I’ll go up and get them, just as a sort of favor
in return for many a kind deed you’ve done for
me.”</p>

<p>“Not you,” Carver declined. “Anyway,
you’ve got all your lumber on the ground now
and you want to stay on the job until you’ve
built the house. I’ll send over a few volunteers
from the bunk house squad to help you throw it
up.”</p>

<p>“That lumber is too green to work up just
yet,” Bart objected. “I’ll rest up in town till
the sap quits flowing through those boards and
they season up till a man can run a saw through
’em. The birds were singing in those very trees
last week.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>It was evident that Bart was bent upon having
his vacation under any possible excuse.</p>

<p>“All right—go ahead and relax,” said Carver.
“Only don’t be gone too long.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be drifting over to Casa and see how the
County Seat ruckus is coming on,” Bart decided.
“I’ll report on the latest developments when I
come back.”</p>

<p>A thriving town had come into being on the site
of the box car which had once borne the name of
Casa and which had been sacked and burned. A
bank and a frame hotel, two general merchandise
establishments, a hardware and implement concern,
grocery stores, restaurants, saloons, two
livery barns, a drug store, barber shop and pool
hall, all glaringly new and mostly unpainted,
made up the business district of Casa, which now
numbered a population of four hundred souls.
Various businesses were conducted in board-floored
tents until such time as the proprietors
could secure more permanent quarters.</p>

<p>Casa, by virtue of both population and location,
had considered herself the logical choice for
County Seat. The government appointee
charged with such locations had listened and
agreed, provided only that a personal bonus of
one thousand dollars be tendered him along with
the other arguments. Graft was open and flagrant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
in the early days of the Strip and communities
as well as individuals paid the price for
official favors. The citizens’ council, a volunteer
body of Casa business men, had flatly refused and
the locater had thereupon designated Oval
Springs, a little camp some miles to the south as
the legal center of county government. This
move was destined to precipitate one of the bitter
and enduring county-seat wars for which the
West is famed. Casa was not alone in her
troubles, for this was but one of three such controversies
at various points in the Strip.</p>

<p>The railroad had backed Casa in the feud from
the first. At the time of designation Oval
Springs could boast neither a side track nor a
station and the railroad had steadfastly refused
to halt its trains. The citizens of Oval Springs
had hastened to erect a large frame building to
serve as a courthouse, a second to serve as county
jail, this last edifice complete except for a few
exterior touches and a coat of paint. The steel-framed
cells were already installed and the jail
was open for business. The trains still rolled
through and eventually Oval Springs took matters
into their own hands and elected to make that
point the terminal from both ways by tearing up
two hundred yards of track. A stock train had
been piled in a gulch, a passenger train derailed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
This last had constituted a case of obstructing
the delivery of the United States mail and Carl
Mattison, appointed deputy marshal in the post
from which Freel had resigned, had been sent in
with a posse to straighten out the tangle.</p>

<p>Alf Wellman, who had staked his claim adjoining
the present town site of Oval Springs,
had been appointed sheriff until such time as an
election could be held. It was freely stated in
Casa that the sheriff and his deputies declined to
interfere with the lawless element that sought
to destroy railroad property and so force the railroad
company to halt its trains. The feud was
destined to be bitter and sustained and it was
slated that another fifteen years should pass before
Casa should come into her own as the permanent
seat of county affairs.</p>

<p>Two days after Bart’s departure he rode up
to the Half Diamond H at daylight.</p>

<p>“Just dropped by for breakfast and to report
on the general situation,” he informed. “I
changed my mind after leaving the other day and
dropped down to view the new county seat.
Quite an alteration in those parts since the night
you and me camped there during round-up without
a house anywheres in sight. There’s trouble
brewing down there in quantities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“Then how did you happen to leave?” Carver
inquired.</p>

<p>“Last night some unknown parties staged a
midnight battle with the marshal’s posse that’s
guarding the relaid tracks, during which it’s reported
that one of the posse was killed and two
others damaged. Under cover of this ruckus
some others succeeded in blowing up the bridge
just south of town and traffic is once more suspended.”</p>

<p>“And which side were you on?” Carver asked.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t hardly determine,” Bart confessed.
“I was maybe just a trifle lit.”</p>

<p>“Being one of our leading lights in that respect,”
said Carver, “I expect maybe you were.”</p>

<p>“As near as I can make out, I was on the side
of the law,” Bart stated. “Leastways I was in
the powder squad that wrecked the bridge and the
sheriff headed the party. My participation was
accidental. I saw Wellman and another man
easing out of town and I trailed them, arriving
just as they touched off the charge, so you might
say I acted the rôle of the passive spectator. The
whole town boiled out and we dispersed among
the crowd. I was dead anxious to be lined up
with law and order, but with the law on both
sides I couldn’t quite make out which one was
proper, so I flitted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“Any idea who led the fight against Mattison?”
Carver asked.</p>

<p>“Not a guess—unless it was Freel,” Bart
denied. “He’s Wellman’s head deputy and it
might have been him—only I can’t someway picture
Freel as indulging in a fracas where other
folks will be shooting back at him.”</p>

<p>“There’s quite a bunch of boys in the bunk
house,” Carver said. “Right after breakfast I’ll
send over a bunch to help you start the house.”</p>

<p>“Right after breakfast I’ll be riding toward
Caldwell,” said Bart. “In proportion to the
way Oval Springs has growed, I’d judge that
Caldwell would be bigger than London by now.”</p>

<p>“Caldwell has about a fourth the population
she had three months ago,” Carver informed.</p>

<p>“I’d as leave see a town that’s shrunk as one
that has growed,” Bart philosophically decided.
“I’m not particular, and I’m bound to find it
filled with new interests. Just two days; then
I’ll be back.”</p>

<p>In the early evening Carver mounted the cow
trail that threaded the low dip in the ridge between
his place and Bart’s claim. As he topped
it he could see Molly coming up the hill from the
cabin. They frequently met here for a brief chat
in the evenings.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t mind Bart’s rambling off for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
few days,” he said, as the girl joined him. “He’s
stayed with it in good shape and it’s only in the
last week he’s been restless. He’ll be back on the
job in a day or two.”</p>

<p>He allowed his gaze to drift across the broad
acreage of plowed ground in the bottoms,—his
ground, seeded to winter wheat.</p>

<p>“Eight hundred acres seeded to wheat,” he
stated. “All put in by trading around. I’ve got
considerable of a farm, but don’t even own one
plow of my own—nor a drill. The grub-liners
put up my fences and broke all my horses to
work. So far I’ve worried along without much
of an outlay of cash; not one cent paid out for
labor. But I’m in debt somewhat for seed wheat
and provisions to feed the bunk house occupants
that turn up every night.”</p>

<p>He directed her gaze over the rich bottom land
extending for five miles down the valley to a
point where the little town of Alvin had come
into being.</p>

<p>“The best land in this whole country,” he
stated. “Every acre of it will bring from twelve
to fifteen dollars the day a man gets his patent.
I’ll buy it up piece by piece, a quarter at a time,
as fast as any party wants to sell; mortgage a
part of it to buy more and turn back every dollar
that comes off of it into more land. Some day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
I’ll own all that lower valley with the Half Diamond
H at the head of it so we can look out
across it all from the house. I’ll follow the price
up till it touches forty and then stop buying.
Then there’ll come a day when we can stand there
at the old ranch house and know that every acre
between it and the flourishing city of Alvin will
be worth a hundred dollars flat.”</p>

<p>As he sketched his plans she could vision thousands
of acres of ripening grain waving in the
bottoms; the huge new barns of the Half Diamond
H groaning with hay and forage crops for
feeding the hundreds of sleek thoroughbred cattle
with which the place was stocked. But all that
was a matter of the future and the present was
sufficiently amazing in itself.</p>

<p>A few months back she had resided in an isolated
line camp on Turkey Creek with no other
habitation within a dozen miles. Now she was
blocked in on all sides by neighbors; Mrs. Cranston,
the ample lady who resided on the next claim
below Molly’s,—and her husband was not really
a gloomy soul. He had merely been over anxious
during the days preceding the run, harassed by
a haunting dread that he would not be successful
in locating a home for his family. He was in
reality a rather genial party, Molly had found.
Then there was Mrs. Downing, the hysterical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
lady, who was not in the least hysterical but quite
normal since Molly had nursed her through an illness
brought on by the excitement of the stampede;
the Lees, with whom Mrs. Downing had
been so anxious to neighbor, had proved to be delightful
neighbors indeed. There was Orkstrom,
the big Dane whose wife toiled with him in the
field; Arnold Crosby, fresh from school, who had
brought his girl bride to share his little frame
homestead shack; old Judd Armstrong and his
serene little mate. The whole countryside for
miles around was peopled with a motley assortment
ranging from retired professional men to
foreigners who spoke scarcely a word of understandable
English.</p>

<p>“You told me once the sort of quiet home life
you pined for most,” he said. “And I volunteered
to set out in search of it. This is it, all
round us, just as you pictured it to me on that
day in Caldwell.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said. “This is it—exactly what
I’ve always been wanting.”</p>

<p>She watched the smoke spirals rising from a
hundred cabins; the stretches of black plowed
ground enclosed by long lines of fence posts.
Far down the valley the new buildings of Alvin
showed as white spots in the waning light. The
new schoolhouse in the bottoms was nearly completed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
the school in which Molly was to teach;
all these evidences of an old civilization fastening
upon a raw new country and lending an air of
permanency and peace.</p>

<p>“We’ve found what we were looking for,” he
said. “What more peaceful scene could one
find?”</p>

<p>But Molly, too, was aware of that vague rustle
of unrest, even a froth of lawlessness, that seemed
to pervade it all; the jobless cowhands riding
their old domain; the bitter county-seat feuds in
progress. Over the line in the Territory two
trains had been held up and looted. Banks in
small towns along the southern fringe of Kansas
had been subjected to a series of daring raids.
The forces of the law were imperfectly organized,
frequently leagued with the lawless. Many old-time
riders of the unowned lands were living on
claims and their cabins were ever open for any
of the boys who sought safety there. They asked
no questions, these men, and answered none. The
Osage Hills in the Territory afforded a safe
haven for those who were hard-pressed and the
way of the transgressor was not difficult. The
girl commented upon this to Carver.</p>

<p>“That’s only the ghost of the old days hovering
over the corpse of the unowned lands,” he
said. “A passing phase. It’s only a froth, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
bubbles and trash on the surface of a deep pond
when it’s stirred by the wind.”</p>

<p>He waved an arm toward the peaceful rural
scene unrolling all around them. “All that is the
solid, enduring part. That will last. The other
is just the last feeble rustle of the tumbleweeds
we’re hearing now.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first2">‘All tumbleweeds hail from nowhere,</div>
<div class="verse">Their one favorite residence;</div>
<div class="verse">But all are bound for the same graveyard—</div>
<div class="verse">Hung up in a barb-wire fence.’</div>
</div></div>

<p>“That’s the finish of all tumbleweeds, girl,” he
said. “Soon or late they get crowded into some
fence corner and their travels cease. Now me,
I’m pocketed that way too, only I’ve taken root.
Aren’t you about ready to come over and ride
herd on me, sort of, and see that some strong
breeze doesn’t uproot me and blow me off somewhere?”</p>

<p>“Not that, Don. I can’t,” she said. “I’m
sorry. I want to go on just as I am for a while.
It’s too perfect to disturb. You haven’t an idea
how much I’m enjoying it, visiting round with
Mrs. Downing, the Cranstons and the Lees and
all the rest, exchanging recipes and listening to
all the family woes and triumphs. You wouldn’t
find much excitement in hearing for the fourth
occasion just what a frightful time Johnny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
Downing had when he cut his first baby teeth;
or about that historical event when Ella Cranston
essayed her first barefooted venture outside
and stepped on a hornet, and what a fearful
expense it’s been to keep her in shoes ever since,—just
refuses to go barefooted even in summers,
since that day, Ella does. But I positively revel
in all that. It’s been so long since I’ve had many
women friends. I don’t want to lose a minute of
all this.”</p>

<p>“I’d contract not to spoil it for you,” he
offered. “You could go right on doing the same
things you do now. Maybe I’d learn to tingle
and thrill over Johnny’s teething myself. He set
them in my thumb the last time I’m over at
Downings so I take it they all come through in
good shape. Couldn’t you learn to be loving me
just a trifle if you’d make a real earnest effort?”</p>

<p>“A lot—without the least effort,” she frankly
admitted. “Don’t you know, Don, that every
real woman is always just on the verge of loving
some tumbleweed? She doesn’t have to try loving
him but to try to keep from it. That’s the
difficult part.”</p>

<p>“Then why not take the easy trail out?” he
suggested.</p>

<p>“All women lean toward the wild weeds—they’ve
got that in them,” she said. “But the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
ones who listen to that call always pay in the end.
Oh, I don’t mean that you’d ever do anything I’d
be ashamed of,” she hastened to add. “You
wouldn’t. It wouldn’t be distrust of you, but
fear for you, that would be my lot if I let myself
get to caring. Don’t you see? I’ve loved two
tumbleweeds before now—Dad and Bart—and
I don’t feel quite up to loving a third. It’s a
woman’s portion to sit and wait for bad news.
So let’s go on just as we are.”</p>

<p>Three wagons rolled up the valley and pulled
into the Half Diamond H.</p>

<p>“There comes Thanksgiving dinner,” said
Carver. “Old Nate was down with us overnight.
Likely he knew that I couldn’t afford to feed the
grub-liners indefinitely so he said he’d ride down
to Alvin and send up a bite for the boys. It appears
like he’d sent it in tons; enough to run to
next August. We’ll be expecting you and Bart
over for a turkey dinner to-morrow.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> one business block of Wharton, a little
town twenty miles north of the Cherokee-Kansas
line, seemed almost deserted. Four men sat on
the edge of a raised-board sidewalk midway of
the block. Two others leaned against the support
posts of a wooden shelter which roofed the
sidewalk before a hardware store. Four horsemen
clattered round the corner, their black masks
furnishing a sinister contrast to the quiet village
scene, and the few citizens of Wharton who
chanced to be abroad witnessed the advent of the
modern bandit, come to replace the road agent
whose day had passed when railroad transportation
superseded stage-coach travel on the overland
trails.</p>

<p>Three of the men dropped from their saddles
before the Wharton bank, two of them entering
while the third stood guard before the door and
the mounted man held the horses of the other
three.</p>

<p>The man in the saddle addressed the startled
spectators and his voice, although not raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
above a conversational tone, carried the length
of the silent street.</p>

<p>“Take it easy,” he advised. “No one’s going
to get hurt unless you start acting up.”</p>

<p>He spoke with quiet assurance but the man on
the door was of a more blustering type.</p>

<p>“All you cattle stand dead quiet,” he threatened.
“Not a sound there! You!” he bawled as
a man shifted his position; “what did I tell you
about keeping quiet.”</p>

<p>“Keep quiet yourself,” the man on the horse
advised. “You’ll stampede the lot of them with
your gab.”</p>

<p>Those within the bank reported later that one
of the inside men was silent throughout the affair,
never speaking a word but instead making his
wishes known by motions of his hand. His companion
seemed nervous and excited.</p>

<p>The pair emerged from the bank and the three
dismounted men swung to their saddles. As the
quartet jumped their horses down the street
the door of the hardware store opened and the
reports of a rifle rolled forth in swift succession.
The man who had held the horses lurched dizzily,
sprawling forward over the saddle horn, then fell
to the street as his mount jumped sidewise. The
silent man set his own horse back on its haunches,
seized the reins of the loose animal and leaned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
from the saddle to help the fallen man to remount.
The blustering party whirled his horse
and emptied his gun at the front of the store from
which the concealed riflemen operated. Spectators,
galvanized into action by the splintering
glass of store windows, ducked hurriedly for
cover. As the fallen man regained his saddle the
three men rounded the corner and followed after
the fourth, who had held on without slackening
his speed.</p>

<p>Near noon of the following day Carver was
well on his way toward Hinman’s range to bring
back the hundred head of yearlings he had purchased
in the spring. The news of the Wharton
raid had been carried to the bunk house by a
grub-liner the night before and Carver turned it
over in his mind as he rode.</p>

<p>“The blustering man on the door was Noll
Lassiter,” he mused. “And the silent man inside
was Milt. The nervous party—I can’t place
him. I’m wondering about the casual individual
who held the horses. It certainly does look as if
they’d cancelled the family feud.”</p>

<p>For Bart Lassiter’s two-day trip to Caldwell
had lengthened into a week and he had not yet
returned. The name of Lassiter had been whispered
in connection with recent misdeeds but the
raids had been frequent and at widely separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
points. It was certain that Milt and Noll Lassiter
had not participated in some of these, their
whereabouts at the time having been definitely
established, and there was no proof that they had
been connected with any one of the numerous
affairs.</p>

<p>Carver angled slightly westward as he reached
the sand-hill country near the line. This was
the poorest land in all the Strip, yet in common
with better stuff it had been staked
solidly on the day of the run. The majority of
these sand-hill claims were destined to change
hands many times before prove-up work would
be completed and patents issued for the land.
Carver found this country unfenced and the few
homestead cabins were mainly deserted. The surface
was rough and choppy, a veritable maze of
dunes, some covered with tufts of tall red grass
and studded with clumps of dwarfed brush and
needle-leaved yucca plants. There were ridges
and domes of white blow-sand, worn by the action
of the wind. These stretches of sand had retarded
the progress of the fire which had swept
the country in late summer and the most of it
was covered with grass. There were occasional
flats carpeted with short, wiry salt grass. As
Carver neared the edge of one of these basins he
suddenly pulled up his horse and peered through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
the fringe of tall grass that graced the crest of
an intermediate ridge.</p>

<p>“Here comes the casual party now,” he commented.
“Wounded as stated in the reports, and
with a posse right at his heels.”</p>

<p>Two hundred yards out in the flat a rider was
pounding down toward the possible cover afforded
by the rough country which Carver had
just traversed. His left arm hung stiffly at his
side and he turned in his saddle with an effort as
he gazed back at a group of horsemen, some
eight or ten of them, that were surging out into
the far edge of the depression a mile or more
behind.</p>

<p>As Bart crossed the low ridge he started to
whirl his horse at the sight of the man posted in
his line of flight, then recognized Carver and
held straight on. Carver turned and rode with
him, noting that Bart’s horse was almost spent.</p>

<p>“I’d trade mounts and let them pick me up
instead. I could furnish a perfect alibi,” Carver
said. “But that wouldn’t do. They’d trace the
ownership of your horse.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let that point deter you,” Bart returned
easily. “This is no horse of mine. I
wouldn’t own him. I borrowed him, sort of, on
the spur of the moment.”</p>

<p>“But the saddle,” Carver insisted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>“Goes with the horse,” said Bart. “You’re
not up to yourself or you’d recognize that it
ain’t my outfit.”</p>

<p>“All right. Let’s switch. Quick!” Carver
ordered. “Duck up that coulee to the left and
keep on the grass where it won’t leave any
tracks,” he advised, when the change had been
effected. “Push him hard and hold to the bottoms.”</p>

<p>Carver veered off to the right. He had covered
something over half a mile when the posse sighted
him as he crossed a low ridge. For another three
miles he maintained a lead, then rode out on to a
high point of ground and halted his weary mount.
The posse had fanned out over a half-mile front
to guard against their quarry’s doubling back
through the choppy breaks. One after another
of the man-hunters sighted the solitary figure on
the ridge and headed for the spot. Carver turned
and regarded the first two that approached.
They pulled their horses to a walk, allowing time
for another pair of riders to draw in from the
right.</p>

<p>“Sit tight there,” one man called. “No queer
stuff now!”</p>

<p>“Where did all this delegation spring from?”
Carver demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>The sheriff reached the spot and assumed command.</p>

<p>“You, Ben, get his gun,” he ordered and one
of the four crowded his horse closer to Carver’s
and reached to remove his gun from its holster.</p>

<p>The sheriff reigned over a Kansas county and
his jurisdiction did not extend to the Strip, a fact
which had not deterred him from crossing the line
with his posse when hot after his man. The men
were regarding their catch with some doubt.</p>

<p>“Was that buzzard wearing chaps?” one man
asked of the others.</p>

<p>Carver grinned and answered the query as if it
had been directed at him.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t say as to the style of his pants,”
he returned. “But his headgear was black.”</p>

<p>“It was for a fact,” one of the posse testified,
eyeing Carver’s battered gray hat.</p>

<p>“What’s all this?” the sheriff demanded.
“What about a black hat?”</p>

<p>He too was studying Carver’s apparel.</p>

<p>“This fellow’s not dressed the same,” he admitted.
“But the horse looks like the one he was
up on.”</p>

<p>“It’s the selfsame horse he was straddling,”
said Carver. “He’s got a better one under him
now.”</p>

<p>“Did you trade?” the sheriff demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>“No, he did,” said Carver.</p>

<p>“Speak up! Get it out quick,” the officer
ordered.</p>

<p>“I was off prospecting around on foot,” Carver
explained. “As I sauntered back I observed
this crow-bait standing where my horse had been.
I caught one brief glimpse of a black hat through
the grass on a ridge and knew that the party
under it was making off with my horse. I
crawled this old wreck and took in behind him.
Never did see him again—which isn’t surprising
in view of the fact that he’s up in the middle of
the best horse in three States. That was one good
horse of mine. I’ll back him against any mount
in these parts. That miscreant made a good
trade. One time during round-up last summer
that pony packed me seventy miles in one day
and wasn’t even breathing hard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, damn your horse and its virtues,” the
sheriff interrupted. “We’ll take you along, anyway.
How do I know you wasn’t planted out
here to help him make a get-away?”</p>

<p>“You don’t,” Carver admitted. “For all you
know, why he might have sent me word about
whatever misdeed he was planning, stating the
exact spot where your posse would jump him
and outlining his route of escape from there on,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
so’s I could be posted just where his horse would
play out and he’d be needing a fresh one.”</p>

<p>The officer frowned at this absurd line of deduction
and Carver grinned at his discomfiture.
The three additional members of the posse, having
ridden well off toward the left, had now
sighted the group on the ridge and were approaching
the spot.</p>

<p>“If you want me for exhibit A in the evidence
I don’t mind going along,” Carver added.</p>

<p>The three additional members of the posse rode
up and two of them greeted Carver by name.</p>

<p>“Whenever did you elect to turn outlaw?”
one man asked. “Sho! We’ve snarled things
up,” he added. “Carver wasn’t into this mess.”</p>

<p>“Do you know this party?” the sheriff inquired.</p>

<p>“Do I?” the man laughed. “If I had a dollar
for every one I’ve borrowed off him I’d pay half
of ’em back.”</p>

<p>Carver’s name was known to the sheriff. It
was certain that he could be found if his testimony
was needed later.</p>

<p>“No use holding you,” he said to Carver.
“He’s made a clean get-away. I’m a little off my
range—no authority here in the Strip; but I
wasn’t going to let the line stop me when we was
right on his heels.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“Why were you wanting him?” Carver asked.
He raised his eyebrows in evident surprise as the
officer gave the details of the Wharton hold-up
and announced that the man they had hunted was
the wounded one of the quartet.</p>

<p>“They holed up somewheres till dark but we
got word they’d headed down this way in the
night,” the officer explained. “Likely this fellow
was feeling sick and had to hide out. He’d
spotted us riding into the sand hills and was just
climbing his horse to make a run for it when we
sighted him over a mile ahead. He’d posted himself
on a ridge so’s he could watch all ways. He’s
up on your fresh horse and miles off by now. No
use for us to go on. I’ll send word to Oval
Springs to the sheriff there that he’s down in this
country.”</p>

<p>“Any idea who he might be?” Carver inquired.
“Anyone along the line get a look at
him?”</p>

<p>“Not one,” the sheriff denied. “He’s in the
clear as far as identity is concerned. Nobody’s
set eyes on him from the time they rode out of
Wharton till we jumped him this morning—excepting
the man who reported that he’d seen four
men ride this way after night. That crippled
shoulder may give him away. We’ll be riding on
back. I’ll want that horse you’re on so we can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
trace its ownership. May get it on him that
way.”</p>

<p>“I’ll nurse him along over to Engle’s place on
Slate Creek,” Carver offered. “Engle will lend
me a horse to ride home.”</p>

<p>When Carver reached the home ranch a man
waited there to inform him that Carl Mattison
desired his presence in Oval Springs.</p>

<p>“Tell him I’ll be with him between now and
to-morrow noon,” Carver instructed the messenger.</p>

<p>Bart Lassiter rode up to the house an hour
before dark. Carver had expected him to wait
until after nightfall before riding in and had
planned to intercept him before he reached the
house.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you lay out somewhere under
cover till it was dark?” he demanded. “Any of
the neighbors see you straddling my horse?”</p>

<p>“A few of ’em, likely,” Bart returned.
“What if they did? I was half starved and got
dead sick of waiting out there in the creek bottoms.”</p>

<p>Carver took him into the house and dressed the
wounded shoulder. It proved to be a clean hole,
the ball having passed through the fleshy parts
without touching a bone. Bart spoke but seldom
while the wound was being dressed. He seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
gloomy and morose, his usual carefree outlook
entirely lacking for the time.</p>

<p>“It was the devil’s own luck, getting jumped
just when I did,” he stated at last.</p>

<p>“Your bad luck set in prior to that,” Carver
returned. “It started when you met Noll and
Milt.”</p>

<p>Bart nodded, then suddenly gazed at Carver in
surprise.</p>

<p>“But how did you know I’d met them?” he
asked. “I didn’t have time to tell you back
there where we changed mounts.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t hard to guess,” Carver said.</p>

<p>“Then you must know Noll better than I do,
if you guessed that,” said Bart. “I didn’t think
the poison hound would shoot me down without a
word.”</p>

<p>“What?” Carver asked. “Noll, you say!
D’you mean he shot you?”</p>

<p>“No other,” Bart affirmed. “The four of
them rode up on me before I knew they were
anywheres within fifty miles.”</p>

<p>“What four?” Carver inquired.</p>

<p>“Milt, Noll and Freel,” Bart informed. “I
don’t know who the fourth was. Didn’t hear his
voice. I was afoot and looking for my horse
when they came riding along. I couldn’t see
who they were but Noll was talking to Freel and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
I knew their voices. They were riding in front.
I asked ’em to raise another horse and save me a
twenty-mile walk and they halted without a word
at the sound of my voice. Then Noll shot. He
cut down on me twice more after I hit the
ground. One shot was close enough to fill my
right ear full of sand. Milt jumped his horse
against Noll’s, cussing him meanwhile, and they
was off at a run before I could pick myself up.”</p>

<p>Carver was conscious of a vague sense of relief
coupled with knowledge of previous deductions
gone astray.</p>

<p>“Where were you yesterday?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sleeping in the house you once owned in
Caldwell, with my horse in the shed out behind,”
Bart informed. “It’s untenanted now so I
entered by the simple process of breaking a window.
I recall that it had been a wild night in
Caldwell and was near daylight when I went to
bed. It was equally near dark when I waked.
The festivities had palled on me and I was ready
to go home so I rode out of town.”</p>

<p>“But how did you happen to be way off to the
south?” Carver asked.</p>

<p>Bart’s moroseness was dissipated by a grin, the
scowl which had stamped his face vanishing before
the advent of some happy recollection.</p>

<p>“I had two pints in the saddle pockets for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
medicinal uses. After taking one of them it occurred
to me what a nice thing it would be to surprise
you by bringing down those yearlings of
yours so I headed for Hinman’s west place.
After taking the other I evidently dismounted
thereabouts for a nap; and after napping I
couldn’t locate my horse. I’d left the reins looped
on the horn, likely, and he headed for home.
While I was hunting round for him I heard folks
riding toward me and angled to cut their trail
and get help, like I told you. Instead I got shot.
Then I rambled on afoot for a couple of miles
and arrived at a house. Some one is making a
late evening call and has left his horse tied outside,
so I borrowed the old wreck and headed
toward home. I was feeling faint-like and weak,
so I tied him up to a plum bush and slept. I
made another start about daylight and then got
off for a rest. It was then I see a dozen or so
riders surging down on me. With half the
county out on the hunt thataway it come to me
that maybe my motives in borrowing the critter
had been misunderstood so I made a break to
escape.”</p>

<p>Carver leaned back in his chair and laughed,
swayed by a mixture of irritation and relief.</p>

<p>“Could you, by any off chance, prove that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
were asleep in Caldwell yesterday and didn’t ride
out till dark?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Positively not,” Bart stated. “No one will
ever know who entered that ex-house of yours by
way of the window. My tracks are well covered.”</p>

<p>“Which is unfortunate in this particular instance,”
Carver remarked. “You’ve stepped
into it up to the armpits. I had been wondering
how to help you avoid serving ten years for something
you did. Now I’m wondering if you won’t
get twenty years for something you didn’t. Did
you happen to hear of the little event up in
Wharton?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of the place,” said Bart. “But I
thought it was against the rules for anything to
ever happen there. What did?”</p>

<p>Carver told him and Bart nodded as he listened.
The black frown once more stamped his
face.</p>

<p>“And we know who it was,” Bart said. “But
I hope they don’t get caught. Noll might get
sent up for twenty years—which span of time
I’d find tedious waiting for him to get out again.
I’d hate awfully to shoot him in the courtroom or
through the bars. My fancy runs toward killing
him somewheres outdoors, so I better get started
before he’s apprehended.”</p>

<p>Carver knew that Bart meant exactly what his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
statement intimated. The breach in the Lassiter
family was now irreparable but its operation
might prove to be even more detrimental to Bart
than the influence which his half-brothers had
exercised over him in the old days when they had
all trailed together.</p>

<p>“You’re never clear of one mess before you’re
into another,” Carver commented. “Damn
Noll! Forget him. Think what it would mean
to Molly to have a shooting in the family.”</p>

<p>“There’s been one shooting in the family within
the past few hours. She despises Noll and
thinks considerable of me. Why should she feel
worse about my shooting him than about his taking
that shot at me?” Bart logically contended.</p>

<p>“Ask her,” Carver returned. “I’ll send you
home now before some of the boys roll in and
start remarking broadcast about your being shot
through the shoulder. I have to ride over to Oval
Springs sometime soon and if you don’t keep that
crippled shoulder under cover meantime, so’s the
neighbors won’t get to speculating about your
case, why I’ll up and jail you myself just to keep
you out of trouble.”</p>

<p>Bart faced him gravely.</p>

<p>“There’s not much in this life I wouldn’t do
for you,” he said. “I’d ride on into Washington
and loot the Mint if you was needing pin money.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
If you had an enemy I’d assassinate him just to
save you the trouble. You’ve used me white.
But there’s some things that just have to be done.
This here is one. I’m out to get Noll. He’s had
it coming all his life. The day Noll passes out
I’ll put myself under your orders and never stray
outside my homestead fence for a solid year except
when you say the word. I’ll give you a
guarantee to that effect.”</p>

<p>An hour after Bart’s departure Carver was
saddling a fresh horse in the corral when a voice
called to him from the edge of it.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Honey?” he inquired,
resting his arms on the top bar of the corral gate
and facing Molly Lassiter across it.</p>

<p>“Don! Don’t let Bart go out after Noll,” she
said. “Before I have time to thank you for
helping him out this morning I’m asking you to
do something else;” she essayed a laugh which
ended in a sob. “But don’t let him do this.
Can’t you think of some way? I never knew him
to be in this mood before. He’s so quiet about it
that I know he means to do it.”</p>

<p>“Likely it will wear off before morning,” Carver
encouraged, but he knew that morning would
find Bart in the selfsame mood. Only years
would suffice to alter the determination he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
read in Bart’s face an hour past. “He’ll forget
it in a day or two.”</p>

<p>He spoke unconcernedly to reassure the girl
for she was nearer the breaking point than he had
ever seen her. Her habitual self-control had
broken down.</p>

<p>“You know he’ll never forget,” she said.
“But I can’t have that—a shooting between
brothers—don’t you see? Not that Noll really
is a brother; but people will always think of it
that way. I wish something had happened to
Noll before I ever saw him—just for what he’s
done to Dad and Bart. I’m wicked enough to
wish him dead; he should be; he’s not fit to live.
But Bart mustn’t do it. He’d never live it
down.”</p>

<p>She spoke disjointedly, her voice high-pitched
and unnatural. Carver vaulted the corral bars
and laid an arm about her shoulders.</p>

<p>“Sho! That’ll all pass off,” he said easily.
“Bart wouldn’t—not after he’d thought it over.
He’s excited about it now.”</p>

<p>She knew that he spoke only to quiet her fears,
that he himself lacked the convictions which he
expressed.</p>

<p>“He’s not excited,” she insisted. “He’s
thought it all over now and made his decision.
Oh, anything but that. It’s the one worst thing I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
can think of. There must be some way. Honestly,
Don, I couldn’t stand that after all the
other things the name of Lassiter has been linked
with.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll put a stop to it,” he said. “We’ll
just fix it so he can’t.”</p>

<p>She noted the change in his voice. He was no
longer speaking merely to reassure her. This
knowledge exerted a quieting effect. She someway
had vast confidence that Carver would find a
way out. Bart’s quiet insistence had terrified her
but Carver had thought of some means to dissuade
him.</p>

<p>“I’ll be riding on into Oval Springs now,” he
said. “Meantime you put your mind at ease.”
He drew her to him and when she made a motion
of dissent he gave her shoulders a little shake.
“Right now,” he insisted a trifle roughly, and she
lifted her face to him.</p>

<p>“You promise you won’t let him?” she implored.</p>

<p>He stood looking down at her with a queer
little smile.</p>

<p>“Rest easy,” he said. “I’ll take a contract to
that effect.”</p>

<p>He dropped the corral bars and a moment
later she watched him ride off through the night
toward Oval Springs.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> atmosphere of Oval Springs reeked of
new lumber and fresh paint. A dozen business
buildings were being hastily constructed and new
houses were started daily in the residence district
of the town.</p>

<p>Carver strolled down the main street. Shafts
of light, emanating from store fronts, splashed
across the board sidewalk and relieved the gloom
of the street. Scores of horses stood at the hitch
rails. The blare of a mechanical piano sounded
from an open doorway, accompanied by the
scrape of boots and clank of spurs. The shrill
laughter of a dance-hall girl rose momentarily
above the din. From another door there issued
the clinking of glassware at the bar and drunken
voices raised in song; the smooth purr of the
roulette wheel and the professional drone of lookout
and croupier. The new county seat was a
wide-open town.</p>

<p>Carver visited one place after another in search
of Noll Lassiter. He discovered him in a saloon
near the end of the street but the man he sought
was in the center of a group near the bar. Carver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
nodded but did not join them. What he had
to say to Noll must be imparted when there were
no others to hear.</p>

<p>Noll was discoursing at some length to his companions
and at the sight of Carver he raised his
voice with palpable intent to include Carver in
the circle of his hearers,—wherefore Carver
listened.</p>

<p>“They hadn’t no business to throw me in,”
Noll stated aggrievedly. “I ask you now! Of
course Crowfoot and Alf Wellman never was any
special friends of mine but they had no call to
lock me up.”</p>

<p>“This may prove worth while. He’s anxious
to have me get it,” Carver decided, and as the
case was restated he gathered the cause of Noll’s
grievance.</p>

<p>Two days before, in mid-afternoon, the two
Lassiters had become openly conspicuous and
Noll had indulged in target practice in the street,
whereupon Crowfoot, acting town marshal, had
declared that such sports were out of season during
the daylight hours and with the help of the
sheriff had conducted the two Lassiters to the
county jail—that structure serving also as a city
prison—where they had languished till noon of
the present day. Their urgent representations,
delivered verbally to acquaintances who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
chanced to pass the jail during the morning, had
resulted in their release at noon.</p>

<p>“The alibi club is in session,” Carver told himself.
“It’s real accommodating of Noll to stage a
monologue just to deceive me. It’s cleared up
some points I was hazy on. The town marshal,
the sheriff and his deputies are still trailing with
the old crowd. It works out like this: Wellman
and Crowfoot jail the two Lassiters in view of the
populace. After nightfall the two prisoners depart
by the back stairs and make a hard ride to
some point near Wharton, hole up there till
afternoon and raid the bank, hide out again till
after dark and make another hard ride back to
Oval Springs. They’re safe in jail before dawn.
This morning they comment through the bars to
pedestrians passing the jail. A perfect alibi—unless
Noll overacts his part and talks himself
into trouble.”</p>

<p>He mused further on the subject as he waited
for Noll to detach himself from the group.</p>

<p>“This deal signifies that every man round the
sheriff’s office is cutting in with the boys,” he
reflected. “Wellman has appointed the two
Ralston brothers deputies in addition to Freel.
The fourth party in that Wharton hold-up was
likely one of the Ralston boys.”</p>

<p>Noll eventually moved toward the door but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
the others accompanied him. Carver followed
them out and called to Noll.</p>

<p>“Just a minute,” he said. “I have a bit of
news to impart.”</p>

<p>Noll turned back and stood facing him while
the others halted a few feet away. Carver lowered
his voice so his words would not reach them.</p>

<p>“You’ve tried for me twice,” he said. “From
now on it’s reversed.”</p>

<p>“What d’you mean?” Noll demanded.</p>

<p>“That I’m going into action the next time you
loom up anywhere within range,” Carver stated.
“I’m just telling you so that you’ll know how to
act the next time we meet. Right soon after we
next sight each other there’ll be one of us absent
from human affairs.”</p>

<p>The group on the sidewalk saw nothing unusual
in this interview,—merely a low-voiced
conversation between two acquaintances.</p>

<p>“Absent!” Noll repeated. “That one will be
you!”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” Carver assented and turned off up
the street.</p>

<p>He spent the night at the hotel and in the
morning sought the deputy United States marshal
whose posse guarded against the destruction
of railroad property and the consequent interference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
with the delivery of the United States’
mail.</p>

<p>“You helped me into this job,” Mattison
greeted. “Now it’s up to you to help me hold it.
You’re to be my right-hand assistant until this
mess is cleared up. Did you know it?”</p>

<p>“Not for sure,” Carver said. “But I suspected
it somewhat when you sent over for me.
I’ll make a deal with you. You can deputize me
now till we iron out this fuss, provided that some
future time you agree to let me deputize myself
on some occasion when I may have to go into
action right rapid and you not at hand; when
it’s a case where county officers wouldn’t fit in
and a deputy marshal would. I’d proclaim that
I was acting under orders from you, meantime
having dispatched word for you to make haste
toward the spot. You arrive and assume command.”</p>

<p>“What’ve you got in mind?” Mattison inquired
a bit doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Not anything special,” Carver returned. “I
may never avail myself of my end of the bargain.
If ever I do I’ll guarantee that the parties I
move on will be eligible to arrest for shattering
some Federal law and I’ll be able to prove it.
That will let you out.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Likely it will let me out of my job,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
Mattison said. “But you’re responsible for my
getting it and I oughtn’t to object if you should
also be responsible for my losing it. We’ll close
the deal.”</p>

<p>“One more small favor before you put me to
work,” Carver requested. “I wish you’d pass
out the word, quiet like, among the boys that the
first time Bart Lassiter shows up here he’s to be
arrested and sent up to Caldwell.”</p>

<p>“What have you got against Bart,” Mattison
asked. “I thought you was friends.”</p>

<p>“That’s why I want him tossed into jail and
kept out of trouble till I give the word to free
him again.”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll toss him if he shows up in
town,” Mattison agreed. “Let’s head for the
tracks and I’ll explain your job as we travel.”</p>

<p>For the next three nights Carver patrolled the
railroad tracks for a distance of over a mile north
of town, visiting the six men stationed in couples
at intervals throughout that stretch. Mattison
conducted a similar patrol to the south.
Throughout that period no move had been made
to tear up the tracks. Trains rolled through
without a halt and no incident transpired which
would furnish the least surface indication of the
existence of a bitter feud. But both Carver and
Mattison knew that the undercurrent of lawlessness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
had not subsided; that it merely smoldered,
waiting an opportunity to break forth.</p>

<p>During the past month there had been five men
killed and as many wounded in the progress of
the county-seat war. Three of the slain had been
members of the marshal’s posse, for Mattison’s
operations were handicapped by red tape, his
instructions prohibiting the firing of a shot except
in case his own men were attacked. The
participants on the reverse side of the question
were burdened by no such restrictions. The
marshal was unable to gather a single shred of
information as to the identity of the men concerned
in any one of the wrecking parties. The
population of Oval Springs was solidly in favor
of any move whatsoever, if only it should result
in the stopping of trains at that point.</p>

<p>In mid-afternoon of the fourth day Carver sat
cross-legged on the ground in the marshal’s camp
beside the tracks a few hundred yards north of
town. He leaned back against a bed roll and inspected
the general surroundings through half-closed
eyes. There was the usual congestion
round the three town wells which furnished the
only supply of water for the county seat. Tank
wagons plied between these wells and the surrounding
country, supplying settlers with moisture
at fifty cents a barrel. Carver straightened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
suddenly alert, as a rider dropped from his horse
at the end of the street. His left arm was bound
stiffly at his side.</p>

<p>“Bart couldn’t wait for that shoulder to cure
before he started hunting for Noll,” Carver said.
He noted that two men had stepped in behind
Bart. They were Mattison’s men and Bart had
not progressed a distance of fifty yards from his
horse before he was under arrest.</p>

<p>“That much accomplished,” Carver said.
“Bart’s safe out of the way as soon as they get
him to Caldwell. Now it’s narrowed down to
Noll and myself. I don’t care overmuch for my
job but she’d rather it would be me than Bart to
go through with it—some one outside the family;
and this will rule me outside for all time.”</p>

<p>Bradshaw rode into camp and joined Carver,
leaving his mount with several other saddled
horses that grazed close at hand. Mattison’s
posse, down to the last man, was composed of old
friends of Carver’s, former riders of the Strip.
Their old calling gone, they now gravitated to
any point which promised to afford a touch of
excitement.</p>

<p>“They’ve let us alone for quite a spell now,”
Bradshaw said. “Time something was breaking.”</p>

<p>A stiff wind screeched across the country and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
the two men sought shelter behind a pile of baled
hay, sprawling comfortably in the sun until
Mattison located them there and reported a bit
of news.</p>

<p>“Headquarters has thrown off the bridle and
issued orders to shoot down every man that
tampers with the tracks,” he informed. “I just
got the word. Now that we’ve got free rein we’ll
clean up this mess.”</p>

<p>These instructions were passed out to all of the
marshal’s men. Two hours after midnight
Carver stood on the tracks with Mattison.</p>

<p>Both men turned to view a vague light that
seemed to flicker up from near a string of buildings
at one end of the main street. The high
wind which had prevailed throughout the day
had died down within the past hour and in the
resulting hush sounds could be heard at a considerable
distance. The light increased and shed
a pinkish glow over a portion of the sleeping
town. A similar light, smaller and less evident,
as if but a reflection of the other, appeared near
the courthouse at the far end of the town. From
somewhere there sounded the muffled thud of
many hoofs.</p>

<p>“I wonder now,” Carver said, as he caught
this sound. “An hour ago, before the wind went
down, a fire would have wiped Oval Springs off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
the map—no water.” He listened again to the
rumble of hoofs. “It’s come,” he announced.
“Casa has been in a ferment for weeks, threatening
to ride over and sack Oval Springs. Now
they’re at it.”</p>

<p>Black smoke rolled above the pink glow which
was rapidly swelling into a lurid glare. Tongues
of scarlet flame now leaped above the buildings
as the fire, started in the rear of them, licked
hungrily up the back of the frame structures.
There was a sudden clamor of voices as sleeping
citizens were roused by the glare of the fire, then
a roar of hoofs as forty horsemen thundered the
length of the main street and emptied their guns
at the store fronts. They wheeled and rode back
through the street, shooting as they came, this
last demonstration for the purpose of keeping
citizens within doors until the flames had attained
sufficient headway to spread beyond control.</p>

<p>The rumble of hoofs died out as the raiders
pounded away toward the north and the population
of Oval Springs boiled out to check the
spread of the fire.</p>

<p>“It’s no affair of ours,” Mattison said. “Dog
eat dog. Let ’em go. Wellman, our good
sheriff, hasn’t exerted himself to help find out
who’s been shooting my boys at night. Let him
handle this deal himself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>The Casa raiders had planned well and if the
wind had held Oval Springs would have been reduced
to ashes in an hour. But the fates had
intervened. The wind had slacked off, then died,
and now a reverse wind blew up and piled the
flames back upon themselves. The fire at the
courthouse had not attained sufficient headway
and a determined body of citizens checked the
spread of the flames. The blaze at the north end
of town was confined to the one section in which
it started, the strong wind from the south beating
back the flames which leaped high above the
buildings. Men on adjacent structures stamped
out the sparks which were belched far and wide
as each burning roof sagged and fell with a
hissing roar.</p>

<p>The conflagration lasted till dawn, was still
smoldering when Carver retired to the bed tent
where he slumbered till high noon. An hour
after rising he sauntered along the tracks to the
north for the purpose of chatting for an hour
with Bradshaw, who was stationed within a short
distance of camp. His friend was nowhere in
sight.</p>

<p>“The sun’s nice and warm,” Carver said. “I’ll
find Brad napping on the sunny slope of the
grade.”</p>

<p>A bare flat extended for four hundred yards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
on the east side of the tracks. Beyond it the
country was broken and rolling, studded with
dwarf brush and scattered thickets of scrub oak.
Carver located Bradshaw reclining on the west
slope of the railroad embankment in the sun, his
hat pulled over his eyes. When within a few feet
of Bradshaw’s position Carver flinched convulsively
as a rifle ball snapped past within a
foot of his head. The thin crack of a rifle accompanied
the sound and a faint spurt of blue smoke
drifted hazily from a black-jack clump on the
far edge of the flat. Carver cleared the edge of
the grade at a bound.</p>

<p>No matter what else might occupy Carver’s
mind, the thought of Noll Lassiter was ever in
the foreground of his consciousness, would remain
there until the matter between them was
settled, and he knew without question who had
fired the shot from the black-jacks.</p>

<p>“Close shooting for four hundred yards.
That didn’t miss me an inch,” Carver said. “Get
down!” he called sharply; for Bradshaw, thirty
feet farther north, had been roused by the sound
of the shot and Carver’s plunge down the sheltered
side of the grade, and he had risen to his
knees to peer off to the east. “Down, Brad!
Duck under the bank!”</p>

<p>The warning command came too late. Bradshaw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
sprawled on his face and slid loosely down
the embankment as the rifle spoke again from
the thicket. Carver ran to his friend but Bradshaw
was beyond need of assistance. He opened
his eyes with an effort as Carver knelt over him.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Brad,” Carver said. “He was
out after me and got you instead when you raised
up in sight. I’m sorry, old man.”</p>

<p>Bradshaw essayed a smile and made a feeble
move to extend a hand for a farewell shake with
his friend.</p>

<p>“It’s all right,” he said—and passed out.</p>

<p>Carver ran back toward the camp, keeping
under cover of the embankment. Several men
had heard the two shots and had mounted the
tracks to determine their source. They saw
Carver running toward camp and knew that the
two stray reports had carried at least some significance.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” one man called as Carver came
within hailing distance.</p>

<p>He did not answer till after reaching the spot
where a half-dozen saddled horses were grazing
just outside camp, his own mount among them.
He slowed to a walk lest he stampede the horses
by a too precipitate approach. Mattison had
come from the bed tent. Carver jerked a thumb
back in the direction from which he had come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Some one downed Brad from the bush out
across the flat,” Carver informed. “I’m going
out to bring in the party that did it.”</p>

<p>The marshal turned to the men standing
round.</p>

<p>“Saddles!” he ordered. “On your horses!
Go bring him in!”</p>

<p>But Carver lifted a hand.</p>

<p>“This is my job,” he said. “I want him
myself. He was trying for me—and Brad’s
been my friend for fifteen years. Hold ’em
back!” he insisted, as the men headed for their
horses. He swung to the saddle. “Send up
word to let Bart Lassiter out,” he called back, as
he jumped his horse toward the tracks.</p>

<p>Mattison countermanded his previous order
and the other men stayed in camp, cursing fretfully
over this sudden turn in affairs which prevented
their going.</p>

<p>Carver rode without caution, knowing that
Noll would have departed immediately after
firing the shots. The man would have a mile
lead by now. The country to the southeast was
a stretch of good land, solidly settled and thoroughly
fenced. A rider heading that way would
find his route confined to fenced section lines.
Noll would head northeast where the country
was rough and mostly unfenced. Carver lined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
his horse out at a run and after two miles he
sighted his man, off to the left and a half-mile
ahead.</p>

<p>When he saw him again the distance between
them had lessened. Noll would hold on without
stopping till he discovered the fact that a man
followed him. Even then he would hesitate to
dismount and attempt to bushwhack his hunter
through fear that Mattison had turned the whole
posse loose on his trail. Another half-mile and
Carver glimpsed him again, this time less than
four hundred yards in the lead. They passed out
of the brush-covered area into a country that,
while still rough, was covered only with coarse
grass. It occurred to Carver that another few
miles would bring them out into a good-land district,
settled and fenced. Noll would never be
crowded out into that section if he knew Carver
followed, for he would be forced to travel along
fenced roadways and settlers would witness his
flight, establishing his identity.</p>

<p>As Carver crossed over a ridge he saw Noll
again, only his head and shoulders visible as he
rode straight away a scant two hundred yards
ahead. Apparently he had no suspicion that
there was a man on his trail, yet it seemed certain
that before now he would have halted under
cover of some ridge to scan his back track and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
ascertain if he were followed. If he discovered
a rider behind him he would halt again at some
other point to determine if others rode with the
first.</p>

<p>It suddenly occurred to Carver that the swift
lessening of distance between them was occasioned
by this very thing. Noll had stopped
under cover to view his back track; had halted
again to make sure that but one man followed his
trail. Even as this thought flashed into his mind
Carver flung from the saddle and dropped flat on
the ground.</p>

<p>He had ridden the length of a shallow draw
and he left it only to discover that the landscape
had flattened out into low waves of ground. It
was the sight of the upper half of a riderless
horse standing in the shallow depression beyond
one of these waves which had occasioned his sudden
fling from the saddle. Noll had dismounted
in the next dip ahead, intending to shoot as
Carver rode into sight.</p>

<p>Carver lay flat on his face and crawled thirty
feet to the north through the shallow basin that
sheltered him, then lifted his head cautiously and
inspected his surroundings. His range was limited
to a distance of fifty yards north and south.
He might crawl back west for some twenty
yards. The character of his surroundings rendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
it impossible for him to move beyond this
restricted area without showing himself to the
man who was cached in a similar depression
somewhere less than seventy yards east of him.
And in all the shallow dip there was not one
point of sufficient depth to permit of his straightening
up on his knees without danger of bringing
his head into view of the man who waited for him
over across.</p>

<p>Inch by inch, Carver worked his way toward a
spot where a few straggling stems of tall grass
were scattered about. Poor cover this, yet even a
few spears of grass break up the view to a surprising
extent when one is prone on the ground. In
thirty minutes he had covered as many feet. He
removed his hat and elevated his head.</p>

<p>First he studied the character of Noll’s retreat,—a
depression similar to the one which
afforded him shelter, a trifle deeper perhaps and
of slightly greater area. But Noll could not
progress a hundred yards in any direction without
coming into his view. Carver knew that
somewhere over there Noll was watching for the
first glimpse of him. He could see the empty
scabbard on Lassiter’s saddle and knew that he
was armed with a rifle. His own rifle remained
on the saddle of the horse he could not reach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
without showing himself to Noll and he was
armed only with the gun on his belt.</p>

<p>“He’s got me handicapped a trifle on location
and weapons,” Carver reflected. “It’ll narrow
down now to which one has the other out-guessed
for patience. What happened to Brad has put
me in the humor to go through with my job.”</p>

<p>There was no breath of wind and the sun
glared down into the depression with summerlike
warmth. Carver crawled back to the lowest point
in his basin and divested himself of his jacket.
An old brake block, dropped from some chuck
wagon in the old days of the round-up, was
grown half over with grass. He pried the block
from its resting place and regarded it, then set to
work, first draping his jacket the length of the
twenty-inch slab of wood and observing the
effect from one side. Then he padded one shoulder
with matted dead grass. His knife, its point
stabbed solidly into one edge of the block, served
as a handle. He crawled north through the depression,
one arm extended, his hand clasping the
knife and holding the contraption two feet before
him and elevated to a point some ten inches
higher than his own head as he lay flat on the
ground. He progressed slowly, squirming forward
a few inches at a time, wondering meanwhile
if any one peering through the grass from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
a short distance away would mistake it for the
flat of a man’s back and the hump of his shoulders.
He covered ten feet; fifteen. When one
peered through the grass from a prone position
the view was none too distinct at best. He
hitched forward another two feet. Surely he
was holding the decoy sufficiently high to bring
it into Noll’s range of vision. Another hitch of
two feet, and suddenly his wrist was jarred by the
sharp sidewise wrench of the knife as a rifle shot
crashed forth from sixty yards to the eastward
and the heavy ball tore through the jacket and
the block across which it was draped. Carver
emitted a single coughing gasp. A split-second
later he flung one arm aloft, the fingers outstretched,
closing them tightly as the hand was
withdrawn. Then he turned back and crawled
to his first point of vantage where the scattering
stems of coarse grass would tend to break up the
view.</p>

<p>An hour passed without a sound save the
stamp of a hoof or the creak of leather as the two
horses moved about a few yards away. A huge
black buzzard wheeled high overhead. His
spirals narrowed and a second vulture joined
him. The two great birds soared on motionless
wings a half-mile above the two quiet figures
sprawled in the grass a stone’s throw apart, each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
invisible to the other but quite visible to the carrion
birds that hovered over the spot. Carver
longed for a smoke. The craving for a cigarette
became almost irresistible and in order to combat
this urge he forced himself to speculate as to
the sensations of the man in the opposite dip in
the ground. He concentrated on this line of
thought until the study assumed actual interest.</p>

<p>Noll, being uncertain on several points, would
soon become restless, Carver reflected. He was
half-convinced that Carver was dead. His
thoughts would constantly revert to that coughing
gasp that had followed his shot, that up-flung
arm with the fingers clutching spasmodically at
nothing. Carver had no such uncertainty to disturb
him and congratulated himself upon this
fact. Point by point he compared his own plight
with that of the enemy.</p>

<p>Time was passing,—time which meant nothing
to him and meant much to Lassiter. Noll must
be wondering if any others of Mattison’s men
had set forth on his trail. Perhaps they were
working it out bit by bit and were even now nearing
the spot. A dozen other contingencies might
arise. A stray horseman might sight the two
riderless horses and set forth to discover the
reason. Carver had nothing to lose by discovery.
He would profit from such intervention instead,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
but the injection of any such chance element
would seal Lassiter’s doom. By thus dwelling
upon Noll’s discomforts Carver was able to partially
assuage his own,—all save that gnawing
desire for a smoke. Another hour had passed.
Then Carver’s mind snapped back from abstract
imaginings to the world of realities.</p>

<p>A tuft of grass over across twitched sharply.
It jerked again and Carver slid his gun out before
him to the length of his arm. For a space
of five minutes there was no other move and
Carver relaxed, that insane urge to have a smoke
at all costs mounting again. A bird hopped close
to inspect him, its bright little eyes fixed on his
own as it turned its head from side to side for a
better view of him. The peak of a hat appeared
above the grass tops sixty yards to the east.
More of the hat was lifted slowly into view until
the whole crown was visible. Carver pictured
Noll’s eyes just beneath it, peering from under
the brim.</p>

<p>But of course the thing was a plant. Noll
would not lift his head with eight inches of hat
above it to announce his position. He was raising
the hat into sight with a stick to lure Carver
into firing as Carver had decoyed him with the
coat. Carver restrained the desire to shoot
through the grass tops four inches below the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
crown of the hat. The thing disappeared only
to come into view once more at a point some ten
feet from the first. Again the move was repeated
and this time the hat was thrust up abruptly
as if its wearer could no longer exercise sufficient
restraint to elevate it an inch at a time. Noll was
becoming nervous, breaking under the strain.
On the fourth event Carver saw a clear space
between the grass and the hat. It dropped back
but the crown remained in his range of view and
for a space of ten minutes he kept his eyes on
that dark spot in the grass.</p>

<p>A movement ten yards to the left of it challenged
his attention. A second dark blot
showed in the brown of the grass. It moved upward
a fraction, the top of a head. Carver noted
the slight sidewise motion as the man shifted for
a better view. His gun hand contracted as he
lined down the barrel but he loosened his fingers
again. It would not do to shoot until he was
sure, leaving him in the same state of uncertainty
which now handicapped Noll. The sun was
swinging low in the west. Another two hours
and it would be too dark to see. If Noll could
hold out until then he could make a clean get-away.
If Carver gave a sign too soon Noll would
know that his shot of two hours past had failed to
locate its mark and he would stay under cover till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
nightfall and then make a run for it. It was the
uncertainty that was breaking him down. Noll
couldn’t go against another two hours of that
sort of thing, Carver told himself.</p>

<p>He repeated this assurance a score of times
after the head disappeared. Two hours of uncertainty
for Lassiter—two hours of craving
for just one cigarette for himself—which would
win out? He composed himself for another long
wait.</p>

<p>Then Noll’s head and shoulders appeared as he
rose to his knees, only to be as quickly withdrawn
from view as he dropped once more on his face.
His voice rose from the opposite depression,
hoarse and unsteady as he reviled Carver, hoping
to taunt him into some answer,—the first
sound of a voice in nearly three hours. There
came a crashing report from the dip and Carver’s
horse went down in a heap, shot through the
shoulders. The animal screamed once as it
struggled on the ground. A spurt of blue smoke
revealed the rifleman’s position but Carver knew
that he was well below the danger line. The
horse ceased struggling. A bubbling rattle announced
the death of his favorite mount. The
voice of the man who had fired the wanton shot
rose with the sound.</p>

<p>“How do you like the sound of that?” he demanded.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
“That’s what will happen to you between
now and dark.”</p>

<p>He leaped to his feet and stood facing Carver,
then dropped back out of sight.</p>

<p>“He’s going to pieces,” Carver told himself.
“He’ll make a break now most any time.”</p>

<p>The exertion and relief from inaction apparently
had lessened the strain under which Noll
had been laboring and he made no other move for
many long weary minutes. Then, without warning,
he was up and running toward Carver’s position,
his rifle half raised before him. He was
within forty yards; thirty. Then Carver lifted
his forearm and fired. Lassiter tottered drunkenly
and shot into the haze of smoke that floated
before Carver’s gun. The ball plowed a furrow
three inches from Carver’s ear and spattered
fresh earth in his face. Carver shot twice again.
For a space of twenty seconds he held his place
in the grass, then sat up on his heels and twisted
a cigarette.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XII</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Molly Lassiter</span> followed her usual daily
routine, visiting back and forth with the Cranstons,
Lees and other neighbors, yet beneath it all
she was conscious of a certain uneasy expectancy,
a sense of waiting for something to transpire.
There had been no word from Bart and his
whereabouts were unknown to her. Somewhere
Bart was making a relentless hunt for Noll and
she expected hourly to hear news of their meeting.
She knew of Carver’s having joined the
marshal’s posse at Oval Springs and there was
ever the possibility that she would get word that
he had fallen in the county-seat war. She had
once told Carver that it was the woman’s portion
to wait for bad news,—and now she was waiting.
In another three weeks her school would
open for the mid-winter term. A few days past
her interest had centered entirely on this great
event but now she found it had been relegated
to a position of secondary importance in her
mind; would retain its minor significance until
such time as both Bart and Carver were safe
home once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>Then a sympathetic grub-liner dropped past
with the word that Noll had been killed in the
county-seat fight. The bearer of the tidings, in
an awkward effort to lessen the shock of what he
must impart, prefaced his announcement with a
rambling admonition to prepare herself for the
worst, and she was ready to shriek out to him to
hasten on to the point of his message. She found
time to wonder at the fact that her chief concern
was a terrible dread that something had happened
to Carver. Then, at last, the man haltingly
explained that Noll had passed out of this
world, one more victim of the county-seat feud.</p>

<p>Her reaction was so intense that she dropped
to a seat on the doorsill and stared mutely at her
informer. The man rode away cursing himself
for breaking the news so abruptly. After his
departure she accused herself of great wickedness
for the reason that she could not wring one
atom of regret from the fact of Noll’s passing.
Rather, after the fear for both Carver and Bart
which had been roused by the man’s lengthy
preamble, she had experienced a positive relief
to find that the news concerned Noll. She hoped
that the man had not divined this, and again she
accused herself of a callousness which she had
never before suspected as a part of her make-up.</p>

<p>She had known that it was only a question of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
time until Noll would come to his end during
some piece of outlawry, a bank hold-up or some
brawl in town, and it was infinitely preferable
that it should have happened in this way instead,—as
the victim of the county-seat war in which
good men had gone down on both sides. It eliminated
the certainty of a fratricidal shooting between
Noll and Bart in the very near future. It
was better this way.</p>

<p>The following day Bart rode up the lane and
within an hour after his arrival he had started
upon the construction of the three-room house
which he had planned a month or more back.
She observed that Bart, notwithstanding the
wounded shoulder which still bothered him
slightly, went about his work with a purposefulness
which had not characterized his activities in
the past. A week had passed without his having
shown any evidence of restlessness or desire to
ride into town.</p>

<p>Now that she had Bart safe at home it seemed
that her anxiety should have been decreased by
more than half but instead it was augmented by
each bit of news pertaining to the intensity of the
trouble round Oval Springs. Another week
passed without the least lessening of Bart’s daily
labors. The house was completed with the help
of a few grub-liners who were stopping at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
Carver’s to look after his affairs during his absence.</p>

<p>They moved into the new house and Molly’s
spirits soared. She sang light-heartedly as she
went about her work. She had a permanent
home of her own and Bart’s tendency to roam
was becoming less pronounced. There was no
longer reason to dread the consequences of any
possible rambles he might take in the future,
since Noll’s influence was now a thing of the
past. Her new school would soon open; and besides
all these things Molly had made a discovery
which eclipsed all the rest. She had told Carver
that she did not feel quite up to having a third
tumbleweed on her hands to worry about, already
having had two, her father and Bart, but she had
found herself worrying every minute since his departure;
and since it seemed that she was to have
the worry in any event, she had as well have her
tumbleweed too. She knew that fact now and
she wanted to tell him. It was to be expected
that Bart would feel the need of relaxation after
completing the house and she had decided that
when these symptoms became manifest she would
suggest Oval Springs as his destination and send
a message to Carver. She had thought much
over the substance and wording of the message.
She would send merely the word that she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
worrying over his connection with the marshal’s
posse. Carver would divine what lay behind the
words and return to the ranch, she reflected; he
understood her so thoroughly.</p>

<p>Bart, however, failed to fulfill his part in her
plans.</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry about my prowling off
somewheres,” he informed her one morning at
breakfast. “I’m one tumbleweed that’s quit
roaming. There’s been a windbreak erected on
all four sides of me that’ll restrain me from
drifting for one solid year. When I make a contract
I keep it—even if it only came about
through a mistake in the wording.”</p>

<p>She pondered over this assertion while Bart
finished his breakfast.</p>

<p>“Carver tricked me, sort of,” Bart amplified.
“He couldn’t dissuade me from setting out after
Noll, but I made a rash statement that I’d stay
here on the place for one year from the day
Noll’s case was settled, having in mind, of course,
that I’d do the settling myself but neglecting to
state it that way. Well, Noll’s case is settled,
though not just the way I’d planned it, and here
I am. No more trips to town until Don says the
word.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad, Bart,” Molly said. “It’s so much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
better this way instead of your being mixed up
with it yourself. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>He pushed back his chair and regarded her.</p>

<p>“I’ll never be convinced but what I’d ought
to have done it myself,” Bart insisted. “I would
have too, if you hadn’t talked Don into beating
me to it. He knew you’d rather it would be him
than me.”</p>

<p>Bart rose and moved about the room, commenting
upon certain angles of the case and from
these fragments she was able to piece out the
whole picture. Bart spoke casually, believing
that she had already become acquainted with
every phase of the affair. The girl sat very still,
her hands clenched in her lap. So it had been
Carver. She had never given that a thought
until now, had not entertained even a suspicion
of the truth, and Bart was assuming that she
knew every detail; that she was responsible for
having sent Carver. An hour past she had told
herself that Don understood her so well while in
reality he understood her so little that he had
imagined she was sending him forth on such a
mission as that.</p>

<p>“But why in God’s name didn’t he let the
posse go out instead of going alone?” she asked
at last.</p>

<p>“That’s just what he couldn’t do,” Bart dissented.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
“He knew that it was on account of his
own personal disagreement with Noll that Bradshaw
had been shot down, that it didn’t have any
relation to the county-seat squabble whatever.
If the marshal’s boys had gone boiling across into
the brush after Noll there was a good chance that
some other good men would go the same route
that Brad had. Don couldn’t chance that. It
was his own personal trouble and he felt obliged
to take all the risks on himself.”</p>

<p>She knew that Carver’s action, judged by the
standards of his kind, would command respect.
But if only he had been content to stand back
and let the marshal’s men go out as a whole! It
would then have seemed an impersonal sort of
affair instead of becoming openly known as a
personal issue between the two men. Even
though she herself had always refused to look
upon Noll as a relative the world at large would
not hold that view. Centuries of custom decreed
that such an occurrence as this should operate as
an insurmountable barrier between Don and herself.
There would always be that between them.
Tongues would wag until the end of time if they
should violate that age-old tradition by permitting
any relationship deeper than mere acquaintance
between them. She must see Don and
explain it all to him. He had made such an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
unalterable mistake; had understood her so little.
But she could not see him till after the trouble at
Oval Springs had been settled and he returned
to the ranch.</p>

<p>Even at that moment the county-seat war was
nearing an abrupt termination. Oval Springs
had grown with amazing rapidity and there was
no longer an object in the refusal of the railroad
company to halt its trains at that point, the reverse
now being true.</p>

<p>Carver watched the south-bound passenger
train come to a halt for the first time in weeks.
The assembled population of Oval Springs
cheered this unexpected event. A group of
officials descended to look over the ground and
one man announced to the crowd that they had
come to select a site for the new station, construction
of which was to begin on the morrow. Surveyors
were unloading equipment. A work train
crawled into town and a hundred men swarmed
off the cars to begin work on a switch track. The
feud was ended and Oval Springs had won out
in the fight. Years later it would break out
again and again until Casa should eventually
come into her own.</p>

<p>Crowds of cheering citizens swarmed the
streets of Oval Springs throughout the rest of
the day and there was every symptom that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
would be a wild night in town. Carver considered
plunging into the festivities. Someway the
thought of returning to the ranch held forth no
appeal; this strange lack of interest was equally
true when he contemplated joining the celebration
over the victory of Oval Springs. He didn’t
care a hang which town had won out.</p>

<p>“There don’t seem to be much of anything
that I do want to indulge in right now,” he remarked.
“So I guess I’ll ride home. You won’t
be needing me any longer,” he said to Mattison.
“If you don’t mind I’ll resign and be on my
way.”</p>

<p>He rode out of town in mid-afternoon and he
failed to stop by the Lassiter’s place as was his
usual custom but held straight on to the Half
Diamond H.</p>

<p>Molly heard through Bart that he had returned.
She expected to see him waiting for her
in the little saddle in the ridge where formerly
they had met of evenings but she watched the
shadows fall on three successive nights and failed
to see him skylined there. Her school opened
with twenty pupils of assorted sizes, ages and degrees
of intelligence and she threw herself into
this new work. As she rode home on the second
night after the opening she saw Carver in the
field. He waved his hat but made no move to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
cross over. The next evening she motioned to
him and he joined her in the road.</p>

<p>“They tell me you’ve got a family of youngsters
ranging all the way from Mexicans to
Bostonese,” he greeted. “How’s the new
school?”</p>

<p>“Perfect,” she said. “I love it.”</p>

<p>“Now me, I’d lose my mind after the first
day,” he said. “Has Johnny begun to shed his
milk teeth yet? It’s a downright shame the boy
has to lose ’em again after all the trouble he had
cutting his first ones.”</p>

<p>The girl remained silent while he made inquiries
concerning a number of her charges, recalling
incidents from their past lives which she
had heard from fond parents and passed on to
him at various times. He had dropped into his
old casual vein as easily as if nothing of an unusual
nature had occurred since their last meeting.
But Molly found it difficult to meet his
mood and chat on trivial topics. She was conscious
of a certain restraint. It was fully to be
expected that he would mention the one thing
which was uppermost in his mind and hers, attempting
to explain it by the code of his kind,
but it became increasingly evident that he did not
intend to refer to it. She cast about for something
to say but could discover no topic. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
mind was too exclusively occupied with that
other.</p>

<p>“That’s a good-looking new shirt you have
on,” she stated at last, and was angrily conscious
of the inanity of the observation in view of all
that was left unsaid between them. But she
forced herself to go on. “I like gray. You
never affect red shirts like the most of the tumbleweeds
wear.”</p>

<p>She could have screamed at the idiocy of it all
and found herself unable to proceed but Carver
inspected the sleeve of the shirt in question and
took the conversation away from her, dwelling
upon the topic as if her observation had been the
most natural one in the world.</p>

<p>“Gray’s not a bad color for everyday wear,”
he admitted. “I don’t run much to red. Reason
is this: There’s eleven or twelve of us children
at home; I forget without counting—but plenty—and
the old man sometimes buys assorted job
lots of clothing that has gone maybe a bit out of
style. One day he turns up with an assortment
of shoes. There’s gray, black, bay and buckskin
shades in that lot—and one pair of red button
shoes.”</p>

<p>He paused to chuckle softly at some recollection.</p>

<p>“The old man takes a squint at those red ones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
and begins to size up my feet. I stage one
frenzied protest. After they’d choked me into
submission and crowded my feet into those red
button shoes they start me off to school and my
worst fears are realized. Right down to this day
I can’t set round in company without wanting to
shove my feet somewhere out of sight. Well,
that same night I steal the old man’s pistol and
drop out the window. I ain’t ever been back.
That seems to have soured me on red for all time.
I wouldn’t even put red paint on my barn.
That’s why I don’t run to loud colors; a quiet
lavender shirt, maybe, for Sundays, or a soft
black-and-orange check if I want to dress up,
but no red for me.”</p>

<p>It was quite evident that he intended to hold
the conversation to purely casual channels. She
knew now that he had not misunderstood her;
that he had assumed full responsibility for the
affair, realizing that it would react against him
but believing that it would be easier for her in the
end if he were the one to go through with it instead
of Bart. He had known that he was locking
himself outside and that explanations would
be of no avail so he was deliberately avoiding
the topic.</p>

<p>“That’s how I came to leave home,” he resumed.
“If ever you note any symptoms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
madness in one of your pupils, why instead of
chastizing him regardless, I’d suggest that you
institute a search for the red button shoes in the
background. Big events hinge on such trifles.
Now if I’d have stepped on a bee like Ella
Cranston did—I forgot to mention that I left
those shoes behind in exchange for the pistol and
set out barefooted—it’s likely I’d have turned
back and developed into a first-rate barber or a
banker in place of winding up as a bronc fighter.
Does Ella still persist in wearing shoes even in
bright balmy weather?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Don! Why did you?” Molly interrupted
suddenly.</p>

<p>“It was due to come sometime; he’d already
tried for me twice,” Carver said, instantly altering
his vein of speech to accord with her own.
“So I might as well have it out right then, I figured,
and keep Bart out of it all. Then he got
Brad. Brad was my friend.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Don; terribly sorry,” she said.</p>

<p>“Don’t you!” he admonished. “It just had
to come up the way it did, seems like. You’d
rather it was me than Bart.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t!” she denied fiercely. “Oh! I
wouldn’t! I’d a thousand times rather it was
Bart!”</p>

<p>She hung her spurs up into her pony’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
flanks and the little horse darted off up the road.</p>

<p>Carver stood looking after her.</p>

<p>“And I didn’t know,” he said. “I didn’t find
out till it was just too late. Don’t that beat
hell!”</p>

<p>Crowfoot, even before the run, had acquired
moderate wealth but neither Freel nor Wellman
had been possessed of any considerable means.
Freel now owned the largest and most remunerative
saloon in Oval Springs. He had occupied
the sheriff’s office since the first election in the
county, Wellman, the original appointee, having
endorsed his candidacy instead of running for the
office himself. Wellman was proprietor of the
hotel, had been elected mayor of Oval Springs
and was a stockholder and director in the bank,
of which Crowfoot was president.</p>

<p>It was generally conceded that the money of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
the ex-cowman was responsible for the rise of the
other two but there were some who, knowing
Crowfoot, doubted that he would use his own
means for the advancement of another. The
three men were closely associated nevertheless, a
power to be reckoned with in business and political
circles, rated as influential and public-spirited
citizens.</p>

<p>There was no longer necessity for Freel to associate
himself closely with the wild bunch, many
of whose operations he had formerly planned. The
years he had served as marshal had fitted him for
this work. He could visualize a scene in advance,
discount its dangerous features and perfect
an alibi that would stand the test. His was
the mind that planned but he had seldom been
present to witness the execution of those plans.
His actual participation in the Wharton hold-up,
the one misdeed of its kind where he had been
present in person, had been occasioned by a desire
to impress upon his associates that he was of
the same fiber as themselves. He had gone out
in a spirit of bravado and returned in a nervous
panic. His main source of revenue was now derived
from protection money which he levied
against the lawless who operated in the county,
these assessments collected through the agency
of the two Ralstons who were his deputies as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
had been Wellman’s before him. Protection
came high and both Freel and Wellman profited
accordingly. Oval Springs was a hotbed of lawlessness
and a concession for any known transgression
could be purchased for a price, a state
of affairs confined not merely to Oval Springs
alone but prevalent throughout the Strip.</p>

<p>The line between the law and the lawless was
but vaguely defined. Instances of the apprehension
of any wrong-doer were decidedly infrequent.
Petty graft and crooked gambling
flourished. As a carcass attracts scavenger birds
so conditions in the Strip drew the vicious of the
whole Southwest. Express messengers conveyed
word of valuable consignments to friends who
would make sure that the shipments failed to
reach their destination. There were bankers who
handled securities at stiff discounts without inquiry
as to their source, jewelers who were
equally incurious about the previous ownership
of gems or gold, judges and county attorneys
who were open to reason and sheriffs who followed
false trails.</p>

<p>But all this was merely a passing phase coincident
to the transition period of a new and untried
territory during its transformation into an old
and proven one. The background was one of
enduring solidity. More than thirty thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
families had found homes in a single day and
these toiled steadily on, unmindful of the wave
of deviltry and corruption that swept the Strip,
such circumstances having no particular bearing
on their daily lives. Later, when they had more
time to devote to affairs outside of the immediate
problem of shaping their homesteads up into producing
farms, they would rise up and cast out the
parasites without apparent effort, for after all
the solid citizens were many and the parasites
comparatively few.</p>

<p>Freel rode out of Oval Springs and he traveled
past occasional fields that were green with waving
wheat. Spring had brought fresh evidence
that the Strip, now a part of Oklahoma, would
eventually prove to be the most productive portion
of the State. Spring crops of all sorts were
coming up in riotous profusion. Young orchards
had been planted round many a homestead
cabin; rows of slender saplings marked the site
of future stately groves. The scattering fields
that had been seeded to winter wheat gave promise
of a tremendous yield and an average of more
than twenty bushels to the acre was confidently
predicted. Orderly garden plots were in evidence
on every homestead.</p>

<p>Since his occupancy of the Sheriff’s office
Freel had several times stopped at the Lassiters’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
cabin. He had haunted Molly Lassiter’s footsteps
for a year prior to that day when Carver’s
inopportune arrival had put a stop to his advances.
In his new guise as a moneyed, influential
citizen he saw one more chance of gaining
the girl’s favor. His manner was affable and
without hint of previous unpleasant relations.
Rather his attitude was one of friendly interest
which any prosperous person might take in the
affairs of a less fortunate acquaintance. Molly,
believing that the past had best be left undisturbed,
received him as she would any other
casual acquaintance. On the occasion of this last
visit Freel found Bart at home.</p>

<p>Bart had worked steadily, seldom straying far
from home but instead finding relaxation at
Carver’s bunk house where the grub-liners still
convened. There were times when he exhibited
real enthusiasm for his work and on such days he
spoke of eventually buying out one or more
neighbors and operating a farm which would one
day rival Carver’s holdings across the ridge.
There were other periods when the monotony of
farm life maddened him and he grew moody and
restless, conscious of the urge to straddle a horse
and be off for some point where distance was not
measured by neatly fenced section lines but instead
was calculated in terms of a day’s travel on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
a horse. It was during the darkest moments of
one of these moods that Freel dropped in.</p>

<p>Bart listened while Freel commented upon
various business and political ventures upon
which he was engaged. Bart was frankly disinterested,
his one thought for the moment being
a desire to step up on a good horse and ride
across a sage-brush desert in the fierce glare of
the summer sun, or, as an alternative, to ride the
same stretch in a screeching winter blizzard; it
mattered little which so long as there would be
neither fence nor human within a radius of
twenty miles. All would have been well except
that Freel, equally self-centered, attributed
Bart’s abstraction to a feeling of envy induced
by the attractive word picture Freel had painted
of his own successes. In parting he drew Bart
aside.</p>

<p>“Any time I can hold out a helping hand you
can count on me,” he assured. “I’m in better
shape to help you on your feet than any man in
these parts.”</p>

<p>Bart was not actively conscious that he was
being patronized but he was aware of a sense of
irritation, and the tone as well as the substance of
the offer brought his ill humor to a sudden focus.</p>

<p>“Oh, hell!” he said wearily. “You can’t do
me any favor except to let me alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>“That’s what I’ve been doing,” Freel returned.
“Hadn’t you noticed?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t missed you,” Bart confessed.
“But keep it up and maybe I will.”</p>

<p>“You’re somewhat in debt to me on that score
right now,” Freel stated, and recited a few details
to prove his point.</p>

<p>Bart’s home-coming with a wounded shoulder
the day following the Wharton affair had created
comment. His saddled horse had been found by
a farmer near the point from which a second
mount had been stolen, this last animal later recovered
by the Kansas sheriff’s posse after its
rider had made good his escape. Rumor had
linked Bart’s name with these events and the
news had trickled to the sheriff’s office.</p>

<p>“Do you think I’m asleep on the job?” Freel
demanded. “I’ve known that all along. Don’t
you call that letting you alone? It all dovetails
right nicely, a clear case against you on both
counts, robbery and horse stealing—two cases
of horse stealing, in fact.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t bother to steal the second one,”
Bart stated. “Don’t make your case too strong
or maybe you’ll lose it. I run across Carver out
there and we swapped mounts, me escaping while
he led that Kansas outfit astray. Maybe you
hadn’t heard that it was Carver’s horse I came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
riding home on—but I can cite you to a few
witnesses who saw it.”</p>

<p>Freel pondered this point. He had not heard
the name of the man picked up by the posse after
the party they sought had presumably stolen his
horse.</p>

<p>“I’ll make it a point to cover any such little
details as that,” he said. “But you’re safe
enough as long as you meet me halfway.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come the full distance and a few steps
beyond,” Bart volunteered. “I could throw
some light on that Wharton affair myself and
some day I will.”</p>

<p>Freel experienced a recurrence of that apprehension
which had assailed him at intervals since
his participation in the Wharton event. He had
never considered it possible that Bart could have
determined the identity of any one of the four
men who had chanced across him that night. It
had all happened with such suddenness; a voice
from the darkness ahead. Then Noll had shot.
Freel had been unaware of the identity of Noll’s
victim till after they had left the spot and Noll
had announced that the voice was Bart’s. Even
then he had not been sure of the point until hearing
the rumors which he had just now recited to
Bart. It had seemed equally certain that Bart
could not have recognized him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>“You’ll have a chance to tell all you know to
a jury,” Freel predicted.</p>

<p>“And right after I speak my piece they’ll cast
a ballot to stretch your neck a foot long,” Bart
announced.</p>

<p>“Mine!” Freel said. “What fool notion are
you working on now?”</p>

<p>“I’m not working—just resting,” said Bart.
“Here you come with all this patter about how
you’ve befriended me by not having me jailed
for something you did yourself. That’s real
generosity. Maybe it’s never occurred to you
that I recognized the four of you when you came
riding up on me that night when Noll tried his
damnedest to kill me.”</p>

<p>Freel’s apprehension increased but he remained
silent until Bart had finished.</p>

<p>“If I start remarking broadcast about that little
event just how long do you imagine it would
take folks to divine where the four of you had
come from?” Bart inquired. “A few minutes
back you was reciting about what a high place
you’d attained in human affairs. Keep right on
mounting—only keep it in mind that some day
when time hangs heavy and I’m craving entertainment
I’ll pull out your props and let you
down hard.”</p>

<p>He turned his back on Freel and retired to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
house. Freel returned to Oval Springs and
sought a hasty conference with the mayor and
the president of the bank. He was palpably
nervous as he recounted the details of this complication.</p>

<p>“Get hold of yourself!” Wellman ordered.
“You’re jumpy. What does it signify anyhow?
One man’s wild yarn about hearing your voice in
the dark wouldn’t even shake that alibi. It’s
water-tight.”</p>

<p>Crowfoot nodded agreement and chewed
placidly at his cigar. He could face such a situation
without turning a hair—as could Wellman.</p>

<p>“Bart’s in no shape to do any commenting,”
Crowfoot amplified.</p>

<p>“But I tell you he will,” Freel insisted.</p>

<p>“Sit down,” Wellman instructed. “Plant
yourself in a chair and quit prowling in circles.
You’ll wear out the rug.”</p>

<p>“Bart might be feeling a trifle venomous since
Noll tried to down him,” Crowfoot conceded.
“It would have been preferable if Noll had quit
living before he took that shot at Bart. But in
order to link you with it he’d have to convince
folks that he recognized your voice at night, then
prove that you’d come from Wharton instead of
any one of a hundred other points on the map.
Not a chance in ten thousand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>“But Carver’s into it now,” Freel pointed out.
“You know what that means. He’s been waiting
for a chance at me.”</p>

<p>“What you mean is that you’ve been waiting
for a chance at him,” Crowfoot corrected. “And
you’re crediting him with holding the same sentiments
toward you.” Crowfoot was not one to
allow personal differences or dislikes to obscure
his judgment. “He’s the kind that’ll not interest
himself in your affairs unless you go romping
over onto his reservation and prod him into hostilities
that he’d likely be wanting to avoid if only
you’d let him. You’d better let this man Carver
strictly alone. He’ll do the same by you.”</p>

<p>Neither Wellman nor Freel was prepared to
accept this bit of advice.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll just tender one more suggestion,”
Crowfoot announced, after finding himself overruled.
“If you’re set on this business, then I’d
urge that you do it yourselves, just the two of
you, instead of hiring it done.” He was familiar
with Freel’s roundabout methods.</p>

<p>Wellman endorsed this last suggestion.</p>

<p>“Absolutely,” he agreed. “Me and Freel will
tend to this matter in person.”</p>

<p>Freel failed to state whether or not these sentiments
met with his full approval. Crowfoot regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
him closely, then stretched and rose from
his chair.</p>

<p>“Once there was three men in a town,” he remarked.
“The rest didn’t count overmuch. One
of the three had sand but no brains. Another
was equipped with cunning but was totally minus
of nerve. The third had both sand and brains.”</p>

<p>“And which one was you?” Freel inquired.</p>

<p>“I mentioned myself last,” Crowfoot answered
without hesitation. “And being equipped like I
explained, it does look like I could do better to
trail by myself instead of being mixed up with a
pair of rat-brained miscreants like you. If you’re
set on stirring up Carver, you can just count me
out.”</p>

<p>He departed and left Freel and Wellman to
perfect their own plans.</p>

<p>They conferred at some length and as a result
Freel spent several days in making quiet investigations
among the homesteaders north and west
of the Half Diamond H. Another evidence of
the change that was taking place in the country
was the fact that the code of silence and refusal
to divulge information no longer prevailed.
Many of the newcomers were willing, even eager,
to impart any possible scrap of information.
Freel found some who had noted Bart’s return
with a crippled shoulder; others that would testify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
that the horse upon which he was mounted
belonged to Carver. He discovered one man
who had seen Bart ride up the Half Diamond H
lane in the evening. In each instance Freel
shook his head and commented upon the fact that
it looked as if the two of them had been mixed
up in it; that it certainly seemed inevitable that
he should have to place them under arrest and
charge them with the crime if the evidence kept
piling up. In each case also he requested secrecy.
In reality he gathered insufficient evidence to
hold either of them overnight but he had created
an abundance of witnesses to serve his purpose.</p>

<p>Some two weeks thereafter a man rode up to
the rear door of the one saloon in the little town
of Alvin a few miles down the valley from the
Half Diamond H. He dropped his reins over
a post a few feet from the door and entered. For
an hour he loitered at a table, playing solitaire
and making an occasional trip to the bar for a
drink and a chat with the bartender.</p>

<p>“Nice place,” he commented after he felt that
their acquaintance had ripened somewhat. “You
own it?”</p>

<p>The man behind the bar nodded.</p>

<p>“Man by name of Carver live round here
close?” the stranger inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>“A piece up the valley,” the bartender assented.
“Not far.”</p>

<p>“Drop in here often, does he?” the man asked.</p>

<p>“Whenever he’s in town—couple of times a
week average,” the proprietor informed. “Drops
in for a glass of beer before riding home. Mostly
he’s in of afternoons; once in a while of nights
when some of the boys gather here. You wanting
to see him?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” the other man admitted.</p>

<p>“You can ride out to his place in half an
hour.”</p>

<p>“Rather see him first and size him up,” the
stranger stated. “Harvest is coming on and he
might use a hand. But I always like to look a
man over before I hire out to him.”</p>

<p>The saloon keeper nodded without comment.
This was no harvest hand. The stranger’s face
was stamped with ruthlessness; straight thin lips,
and above them a pair of wide-set cold black eyes.</p>

<p>“Point him out to me when he comes in, will
you?” he requested. “So’s I can sort of size
him up.”</p>

<p>Again the barman nodded. He noted the convenient
arrangement; the open back door with
the saddled horse just outside.</p>

<p>“Sure,” he laconically assented. “I’ll tip you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>Carver failed to appear and when the usual
evening crowd began to assemble the stranger
departed. The following afternoon he reappeared,
leaving his horse at the same convenient
post just outside the rear entrance.</p>

<p>“You’d never recognize me if you was to see
me again, now would you?” he asked the proprietor.
“You couldn’t accurately describe me
right now; and for all you can remember that
bay horse of mine is a sorrel.”</p>

<p>He shoved two gold coins across the bar and
fixed the other man with his black eyes. The
saloon man pocketed the money.</p>

<p>“Correct on all counts,” he agreed.</p>

<p>The stranger returned to his table and the bartender,
under pretense of arranging glassware
and bottles, placed a long-barreled forty-five on
a shelf just under the bar. One never could tell.
He had been old-time rider of the unowned
lands and could rightly read his signs. A few
stray customers dropped in and departed. The
liveryman lingered over two glasses of beer. The
banker stepped in for his afternoon nip the moment
the bank was closed for the day, and the
keeper of the general store came in with the proprietor
of the lumber yard. Three neighboring
farmers entered together and shook the dice to
determine who should pay for the round. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
stranger surveyed each new arrival, peering
from beneath the brim of his hat while apparently
absorbed in his game. Each time the man
behind the bar shook his head. When the last of
these patrons had departed Carver came in alone.</p>

<p>“A pint bottle of your best beer for me,
Jimmy,” he greeted. “An’ another one for
you.”</p>

<p>As Carver crossed to the bar the proprietor
noted that he was not wearing his gun. He had
discarded the weapon the day of his return from
Oval Springs the preceding fall and had never
worn it since. The bartender gazed fixedly at the
man at the table, then slowly shook his head
again, a signal which Carver could not fail to
observe.</p>

<p>Carver accorded the stranger one casual
glance. He could see the rump of the horse that
stood outside the open rear door. Jimmy spoke
to the stranger.</p>

<p>“That fellow Carver you was wanting to see
just rode up the street,” he said. “He’ll likely
be in any time now.”</p>

<p>The man at the table nodded, frowning
slightly at this reference before a third party.
Carver turned, apparently noting his presence
for the first time.</p>

<p>“Step up,” he invited. “I’ve only time for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
one; have to be dangling along toward home; but
you can linger over yours. Name it.”</p>

<p>The stranger was anxious to be rid of him before
the man he expected came in, so he moved to
the bar in order to hasten proceedings. Jimmy
set his drink before him. The man nodded his
thanks and remained silent, not desiring to open
a conversation lest it should cause his host to alter
his decision to depart at once. Jimmy was
slouching against the rear of the bar directly
across from him, one hand resting on the shelf
beneath it as if to support his weight. Carver
picked up the pint of beer as if to drink from the
bottle; then, as the stranger reached for his drink,
Carver swung the heavy bottle by the neck. The
man went down as the weapon struck him behind
the ear.</p>

<p>“After your opening remarks it looked like
the wise thing was to lay him out first and make
inquiries later,” Carver said as he retrieved the
fallen man’s gun.</p>

<p>“He was out for you,” Jimmy informed. “I
don’t know why but maybe you do.”</p>

<p>“Not an idea; never laid an eye on him before,”
Carver asserted.</p>

<p>“He’s been waiting two days,” Jimmy said.
He removed his hand from beneath the bar and
exhibited the long-barreled gun. “I had this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
shoved against the front side of the bar within
a foot of his vitals so I could touch it off through
the wood in case of a slip. Them’s only half-inch
boards there in front. You and me has been
friends a long time and I was half minded to
down him before you showed up; only you can’t
put a man across just because he’s inquiring
about a friend, no matter what you suspect about
his intentions—not without getting thirty years
or else take to the hills. But I was here to see
that things came out all right.”</p>

<p>“I wonder now,” Carver said, looking down
at the man on the floor. “I wonder who sent
him.”</p>

<p>“You knew, didn’t you, that Freel has been
round collecting evidence against Bart in that
Wharton affair?” Jimmy asked. “I’ve been
hearing that for quite a piece back. Folks get to
talking over their drinks. Most always they do.”
He recited a few comments which had come to
his ears. “Just thought I’d tell you. If you
look under that party’s vest you’ll find a deputy’s
badge. That’s a hard layout up at the county
seat and you’ve had words with different heads
of the ring, so I gather.”</p>

<p>“That clears up the reason for his being here,”
Carver said. “They sent him. He’d make a
clean get-away if he could—flash that deputy’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
badge if he couldn’t, and they’d back him
up.”</p>

<p>“He don’t know that you’re Carver,” Jimmy
said. “I’ll bring him round after you leave and
explain that you was a friend of Carver’s and
decided that things wasn’t right when I made
that incautious remark. That will put me in the
clear. I’ll announce how he’s unsafe in these
parts; that you brought in twenty-odd friends to
view him laying there, face up, on the floor; that
they marked well his features and declared open
season on him anywheres in this part of the State.
If he believes me he’ll high-tail for parts unknown—and
if he don’t, why, I’ll send him
there.”</p>

<p>Carver rode out to the Half Diamond H and
entered the house. When he reappeared he was
wearing his gun and he rode on across the ridge
to the Lassiters. He found Bart seated on the
corral bars, his chin propped in his hands as he
gazed moodily across a field of ripening grain.</p>

<p>“How long since you indulged in some
thoughtless comments about Freel’s being mixed
up in that Wharton hold-up?” Carver asked.</p>

<p>“Two weeks—maybe three,” Bart returned.
“He was so satisfied with himself that I just
thought I’d tell him.”</p>

<p>“And right after that he started connecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>
you and me up with it,” Carver said. “He’s
been exerting himself to inquire among folks
about your horse being found up near where
you departed with that old crow-bait you was
on when I met you; about that Kansas outfit
jumping a wounded outlaw and picking me up
instead, and how you turned up on my horse,
you being shot in the shoulder.”</p>

<p>“Sho!” Bart deprecated. “He couldn’t make
that stick. You don’t imagine, now do you,
that Freel’s fool enough to have us jailed? Not
when I could spill what I know. He wouldn’t
even consider it.”</p>

<p>“That’s what he wouldn’t!” Carver agreed.
“He’s just creating a background. We’re not
slated to languish in jail, you and me. We’re
marked out for the slaughter.”</p>

<p>Bart brightened.</p>

<p>“No!” he exclaimed. “Surely you can’t
mean that something is going to happen. It will
provide me with a fresh interest in life if there’s
a prospect that I might possibly lose it. And
how will all this come to pass?”</p>

<p>“Killed while resisting arrest,” Carver stated.</p>

<p>“Sounds reasonable,” Bart admitted. “I’ll
positively guarantee to resist.”</p>

<p>“Before you’re ever arrested you’ll be much
too dead to make any protest,” Carver predicted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
“Freel has planted the idea in folks’
minds that before long he’ll have to book you and
me for that deal. It’s been whispered about and
they’re sort of expecting it. Then some day he’ll
drag in our corpses and announce that we’d been
shot while resisting his efforts to take us.”</p>

<p>“Interesting but only part way convincing,”
said Bart. “You’ve neglected to explain how
he’s to gain possession of our corpses so he can
start dragging ’em in. I’ll remonstrate with
him considerable before I’ll let him have mine.”</p>

<p>“He won’t collect it in person,” Carver said.</p>

<p>“Maybe I’m supposed to send it to him,”
Bart suggested. “But he don’t deserve any such
favors from me. I consider his scheme a flat
failure, myself.”</p>

<p>“That county-seat aggregation is a hard bunch
to go up against, the way they’re sitting right
now,” Carver said. “They’ve got influence and
power behind ’em. This way of eliminating a
troublesome party is time-tried and tested. It’s
found favor with many a sheriff and chief of
police before now and it’s an old favorite with
Freel.”</p>

<p>“Then it appears that the clever thing to do
is for us to organize too,” Bart volunteered.
“You can act as the chief and send me out to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
get Freel. I’ll dry-gulch him so far from nowhere
that even the coyotes won’t find him.”</p>

<p>“Some other time,” said Carver. “Not now.
We could hardly ride into town and murder
the mayor and the sheriff all in one day without
some sort of excuse. It would create unfavorable
comment. This deal down at Alvin bears
the brand of Freel’s deep-seated planning. It’s
likely they’ll come after us themselves the next
time they try it, just so as to give it the earmarks
of a lawful attempt to arrest. Meantime we’ll
have to work up a background of our own. The
county seat needs cleaning up wholesale. If
a man’s going to live anywhere he might as well
have decent conditions. Once folks get that in
their minds we can defend ourselves and still
render a patriotic service to the county as a
whole.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Bart agreed. “After you’ve unfurled
the flag I’ll lead the last desperate charge
with the whole county cheering. But it still
appears to me that it would be simpler for me
to lay out behind the hedge somewheres and do
a little bushwacking myself.”</p>

<p>“Meantime, just in case Freel sends out
another hired killer, I wouldn’t lay myself open
to any chance stranger that comes dropping
along,” Carver advised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“The first stranger that shows up anywhere
within three hundred yards goes down in the
smoke,” Bart assured.</p>

<p>Molly Lassiter came from the house as Carver
turned to leave. He did not come often of
late and she walked with him a short distance
up the trail.</p>

<p>“We’ll start cutting next week,” Carver
stated. Their talks were largely impersonal
these days. “Harvest is crowding close to us
now.”</p>

<p>“Bart expects to start cutting Monday,” she
said. “How many bushels do you think your
wheat will thresh out?”</p>

<p>“It’ll run close to twenty,” he estimated.
“Maybe more. We ought to get fifteen thousand
bushels or better.”</p>

<p>“And more next year,” she said. “You’ll put
out more wheat this fall, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Likely,” he answered. “I hadn’t quite made
all my plans for next season.”</p>

<p>He had mentioned the fifteen thousand bushels
of wheat casually and without elation. It would
pay for the new farm machinery with which the
Half Diamond H was now stocked but for which
he still owed, leaving him a big margin for future
operations. This first year’s crop would put him
on a solid basis and well on his way toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
maturity of his original plan to buy all of the best
land in the valley. By the time other homesteaders
could prove up on their filings he would
be in a position to buy out all who would sell.
He had no present need even to avail himself
of the assistance which both old Joe Hinman
and Nate Younger were anxious to extend.
Younger’s outfit had been the largest in the
unowned lands in the old days and now Carver
was building it up into the largest of the new day
that had dawned. He had been top hand for
both the Box Bar and the Half Diamond H
under the old régime, a moving spirit among the
riders of the Cherokee Strip, and now he had
become a leader among the settlers. Both of his
old employers, having taken a part in raising him,
were duly proud of the fact; theirs still the loyalty
that had always prevailed between an owner
and the men who rode for his brand. The easy
road to success now opened invitingly to Carver
but he found no joy in the prospect. He had
worked steadily toward his original aim but his
initial enthusiasm was lacking.</p>

<p>The girl had observed this change and it
troubled her. Of late Carver had exhibited a
restlessness that was akin to Bart’s; and she
wondered. He had gone so far; would he turn
back now?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>She accompanied him but a short distance and
the conversation was confined to impersonal
topics. She observed that for the first time in six
months he was wearing his gun. As they parted
he noted her troubled gaze resting upon it.</p>

<p>“Sho! This?” he said, tapping the weapon.
“I someway don’t feel dressed up without it. I
wear it as an ornament, kind of, the way a girl
wears a ribbon,” and he moved on up the trail.</p>

<p>A few days later Molly mounted the ridge and
watched the start of the harvesting. There was
nothing to attract swarms of harvest hands such
as crowded into the country farther north where
the whole landscape seemed a solid body of wheat.
Another year, when the acreage seeded to wheat
would be increased fourfold, then they would
come. But Carver had found no scarcity of
hands to help him harvest his crop. From her
point of vantage the girl could see tall-hatted,
chap-clad men toiling in the fields. Later in the
season, after the wheat had been stacked, she
would see them plowing. They rode their horses
out to their work as they had always done, and
left them standing about.</p>

<p>She would see no other harvest such as this.
Another season and the wheat fields of the Strip
would be invaded by the riffraff that always
came south for the harvest and followed it north.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
Then the tumbleweeds would be gone. Now they
had rallied to lend a helping hand to one of their
own kind, one man who had understood. And as
she watched them toiling at these unfamiliar tasks
she experienced a thrill of sympathy for the men
who had helped to make homes possible for others
and now found no place in the new scheme of
things for themselves. For the riders of the
waste places had ever been the vanguards of
civilization. Fur traders had skimmed the riches
of their calling from a vast territory and departed,
leaving it no more habitable than before;
gold seekers had prospected the hills and passed
on but the cowhands had stayed to make the
West habitable for those who should follow.
And now that the followers had come there was
no further use for the ones who had led the
way.</p>

<p>As the summer advanced the girl observed how
swiftly the ranks of the grub-liners were depleted
as they were forced to realize the fact that spring
work would never open up for their sort again.
Families of Cherokees still prowled the countryside
at will, pitching their teepees along the
streams, the squaws begging incessantly from one
homestead cabin to the next. The settlers, expecting
nothing better from the Indians, were
prone to tolerate this sort of nuisance but looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span>
with increasing disfavor upon the nomadic white
riders that drifted about in much the same aimless
fashion. Yet they were not parasites, these men,
even though the newcomers so viewed them.
Rather they came from a proud fraternity. In
grub-lining they had been merely following an
ancient and respected custom of their kind and
when they now found that this no longer prevailed
they desisted.</p>

<p>It was only through Carver’s insistence that
grub-liners still continued to drop in at the Half
Diamond H. Their presence created the one
break in the monotony that seemed closing in
upon him. He made that clear to each comer
and urged each one to return. But another old
custom was dying and the number of grub-line
riders who turned up for meals at the Half
Diamond H was depleted by half before the
summer was ended, as these jobless ones drifted
into other lines.</p>

<p>One by one, the girl watched them go and she
wondered how they would fare in these new pursuits
which they adopted, not from choice but
from necessity. The majority would sink to
oblivion, drudging at tasks which they had always
despised. But there were some whose names were
slated for fame in the annals of this new Southwest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span>Carl Mattison was destined to become one of
the most-famed marshals of all time. Even now
the fame of his reputation as a man hunter was
mounting. The name of Crowfoot was slated to
become synonymous with prestige and power,
linked with perhaps the most impressive fortune
in the whole Southwest. There would be many
others who would attain high places. Milt Lassiter
would create a place in history as one who
would defy the law for a dozen years with a price
on his head and with every officer in five States
desirous of collecting it. And this last-named
career was even now exerting its influence on
Molly’s understanding of the conditions which
prevailed in this new land.</p>

<p>In the main the old conventions were respected,
old traditions upheld, but modified to fit conditions
as they were, not as other communities decreed
that they should be. Here actualities were
everything, appearances nothing, and there was
not yet that rigid adherence to minor banalities
that were accepted as eternal verities in older
communities where such details were considered
the bulwark of smug respectability. Here a man
was judged by what he stood for in his present
environment, his daily relations with his neighbors,
not by what his family had accomplished in
generations past,—for the past had no part in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
this new land that lived in the present with an
eye to the future. Ex-convicts were making a
new start with their families; former wildlings
were making good and the rising above past
transgressions was considered a cause for congratulation,
not one for reproach. Milt Lassiter’s
ill fame did not react to the detriment of
either Bart or the girl, their neighbors valuing the
two for themselves alone.</p>

<p>This knowledge brought in a new doubt to
Molly—a doubt which fostered a certain content.
After all, in a land of new standards, was
it right that her adherence to a moth-eaten tradition
should keep Carver and herself apart? This
thought, gradually crystallizing into a conviction,
brought with it a measure of comfort, but Carver,
not knowing, experienced a daily increase of restlessness
and discontent.</p>

<p>Few times when the bunk house held more than
three grub-liners and all too frequently it was
unoccupied. Carver found time dragging slowly
and days and nights were equally monotonous.
He knew that he could sell his holdings for a
considerable sum. Should he sell out and migrate
to some point where there was still some open
range available and buy out a small cow outfit?
He debated this problem but lacked his usual
gift of quick decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>There came a night when several old friends
rode up to the bunk house. Joe Hinman and
Nate Younger dropped in for one of their frequent
overnight visits and Bart Lassiter came
across the ridge. A stud game was in order and
Carver rose and went to the house, brought forth
a silver dollar and addressed it.</p>

<p>“Little lonely dollar, you was to mount up to
a million. You haven’t mounted that high yet
but if I’d follow through it’s likely you’d attain
it. But is that what we’re wanting after all? I’ll
put you to the test—fair God or false—and
let you decide it for me.”</p>

<p>He returned to the bunk house and took out a
fifty-dollar stack of chips, tossing one red chip
back and replacing it with the silver dollar.</p>

<p>Old Joe Hinman regarded the coin that
crowned the stack of chips.</p>

<p>“Seems like I’ve seen the selfsame coin before,”
he commented. “Surely now, you
wouldn’t go and risk it. It’s led you quite a
piece, that dollar has.”</p>

<p>“But maybe not in just the right direction,”
Carver said. His thoughts reverted to the day he
had acquired it.</p>

<p>“What depends upon the outcome?” old Joe
inquired. “Which way will you leap?”</p>

<p>“Just this one stack,” said Carver. “If I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
double it I stay. If I lose I go. It means the
difference between here and somewhere else;
pumpkins or tumbleweeds, cows or crops—for
one more year.”</p>

<p>An hour later he cashed in a double stack and
the cards had decreed that he stay for another
year.</p>

<p>Bart Lassiter leaned back in his chair and
grinned sympathetically.</p>

<p>“My year has another six months to run,” he
said. “I’ll be free before you regain your liberty.
You’ll find me waiting for you somewhere out
yonder when your sentence has expired.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> settlers stood in the saloon in Alvin.
The proprietor lowered his voice and leaned
across the bar.</p>

<p>“Look you, now—there’s going to be a killing,”
he predicted. He jerked a thumb toward
the rear door. “Right out there is where he left
his horse and for two days he set there at that
table waiting for Carver to come in.”</p>

<p>Jimmy had just recited the incident of the
stranger’s attempt to take Carver unawares and
was now merely adding a few conclusions of his
own to lend an air of spice and mystery to the
tale.</p>

<p>“He knows too much about folks that are running
things in the county seat, Carver does; him
and Bart Lassiter,” Jimmy stated. “A bartender
hears things. Folks get to talking over
their drinks. Most always they do. I’ve heard it
said for a positive fact that Bart saw Wellman
blow up the bridge out of Oval Springs the
night the up-passenger was ditched and two men
killed. Wellman was sheriff at the time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>It seemed that the two homesteaders had also
been hearing things.</p>

<p>“United States mail went up in smoke that
night when the mail car burned,” said one. “I’ve
heard that Mattison’s still making inquiries about
that. He never quits, Mattison don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, and who’s the two men that could
convict Wellman and get him hung a mile high?”
The saloon man pointed out triumphantly.
“Who, now? Why, Bart Lassiter! And Carver!
I’d never want it said that it come from
me; it’s only between us three. But who is it
that knows Freel led the shooting when some of
Mattison’s men was killed at the same time Wellman
was wrecking the bridge? Whoever knew
that would be dangerous to Freel, wouldn’t he?
See how it all works out?”</p>

<p>The two nodded agreement.</p>

<p>“There’s a dozen of Carver’s close neighbors
that swear he was home the whole day of that
Wharton business that Freel was trying to connect
him up with,” one volunteered. “I guess
Freel seen it wouldn’t do any good to have him
put under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Arrest! Listen!” and Jimmy leaned farther
over the bar. “That was months back. It’s no
arrest that he wants. Didn’t I say there was due
to be a killing? He was just paving the way for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
it. Mark me, now! Some day we all will hear
that Carver and Bart has been arrested—dead!”
He lowered his voice still farther.
“The fellow that left his horse out there while he
waited for Carver was wearing a deputy’s badge
under his vest. But he didn’t appear anxious
to arrest Carver alive.”</p>

<p>Jimmy sighed and passed the two men a drink
on the house. Later he would charge that bit of
hospitality against the sum Carver had left with
him for the purpose.</p>

<p>“Of course I wouldn’t want to be quoted,” he
concluded. “But a bartender hears things.
Folks get to talking over their drinks. Most
always they do.”</p>

<p>It was perhaps the hundreth time he had detailed
his conclusions to different customers in the
past two months. In various parts of the country
others of Carver’s friends had been similarly
occupied in breathing their suspicions into willing
ears. It was being asked why no arrests were
made in the county except for minor offences.
The settlers, since their first crop was harvested
and they had more leisure time to devote to
affairs outside their own personal labors, were
giving thought as to the manner in which the
county seat was managed; and their opinions
were being furnished ready made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>A quiet individual turned up in Oval Springs
and made a few discreet inquiries, interviewing
perhaps a dozen residents of the town, his queries
in each case the same. He merely asked if they
could state positively that Freel and the Ralstons
had been in town on a certain date some months
back; and if they were willing to testify that Milt
and Noll Lassiter had been held in durance
throughout that same day. The date was that of
the Wharton hold-up. No man could swear positively
to these facts. Whenever some party
volunteered the information that he was equally
unable to swear to the contrary, the inquirer
merely nodded and replied that it would be quite
unnecessary. Then, after three days in the
county seat, he left town in the night and was
seen no more. None had witnessed his departure;
he had told no man his business and there
was widespread conjecture as to whether or not
he was in the employ of the Wharton bank.</p>

<p>He rode up to the Half Diamond H at daylight
on the morning after the cards had decreed
that Carver should remain for another year. He
declined the money which Carver would have
given him to cover expenses.</p>

<p>“Just for old times’ sake,” he said, and rode
south to catch a train out of Enid for his home
ranch in Texas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>And just across the ridge Bart Lassiter was
recounting the outcome of the previous night’s
poker session to his sister. The girl experienced
a queer little pang when she heard that Carver
had risked the silver dollar which he had treasured
for so long a time. She knew its associations, also
that it rested within her power, and hers alone, to
reinstate them, vested with all their former meaning.
A small thing perhaps, but relatively unimportant
events are frequently more significant
than the large and obvious, and this incident in
some way served to fix the conviction that had
been growing upon her for weeks past. After all,
what did anything matter but her own viewpoint
and Carver’s? But Hinman and Nate Younger
were waiting to ride with her to Oval Springs for
the first county fair, from which point she would
accompany them to Caldwell for a few days before
the opening of her school for the fall term.
The two old cowmen had planned this trip for
weeks and she could not disappoint them now.
She would be more sure of herself before the day
of her return; would have time in which to determine
whether or not the new-found conviction
was permanent. And suddenly she knew that she
was sure of herself now,—very sure; but her two
old friends were waiting. She drew Bart aside.</p>

<p>“Tell Don not to risk it again,” she said. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
want him to keep it always. Tell him that for
me.”</p>

<p>And Bart, deciding that his sister’s whims had
already imposed far too many restrictions upon
both his own activities and Carver’s, carefully
refrained from delivering the message. Instead,
he registered a protest when he crossed the ridge
to see Carver.</p>

<p>“I’m becoming downright weary of listening
to warnings,” he fretfully declared. “Never a
day goes by but what some friendly soul drops
past to inform me that Wellman and Freel are
scheming to play it low-down on me. Every man
in the county must know it by now.”</p>

<p>“The most of them,” Carver agreed. “If
anything was to happen to us now there’d be five
hundred men rise up and point out to their friends
that they’d been predicting that very thing—that
they’d been telling ’em all along how Wellman
and Freel was planning to murder us some
night.”</p>

<p>“It’s nice to know that we’ll be vindicated after
we’re dead,” said Bart. “But I was wondering
if there maybe wasn’t some method by which we
could go right on living even if we don’t get quite
so much credit for our part in the affair. Personally
I don’t approve of trifling round trying
to set the whole county on their trail when one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
man could terminate their wickedness in two
brief seconds.”</p>

<p>“But it’s paved the way for the clean-up of the
county seat,” said Carver.</p>

<p>“Let’s you and me ride over and clean it up in
the old wild way,” Bart urged.</p>

<p>“Only we’ll let them ride out here,” Carver
substituted. “That background I was speaking
about a while back is all arranged.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re satisfied with the background,”
Bart returned. “I still maintain that
I ought to secrete myself behind a sprig of scrub
oak and wait until Freel comes riding into the
foreground. That way we’d take ’em front and
rear. But anyway suits me, if only it transpires
soon.”</p>

<p>“Real soon now,” Carver promised. He
turned to a grub-liner who was saddling his horse
in the corral.</p>

<p>“You’ll find Mattison waiting in the hotel at
Casa,” he informed. “He’ll be expecting the
message. Tell him just this: That my time has
come to deputize him. He’ll know what to do.
Then you forget it.” He turned back to Bart.
“Real soon now,” he repeated. “That’s the chief
reason why Hinman and old Nate insisted on
taking Molly over to enjoy herself at the fair.”</p>

<p>The girl was, in all truth, enjoying herself at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
the fair. It was as old Joe Hinman remarked to
a group of friends in the lobby of Wellman’s
hotel.</p>

<p>“Nate and me are giving the little girl a vacation,”
he said. “First time she’s been away from
that homestead overnight since Bart filed on it.
She thinks a lot of that little place, Molly does.
Even now she won’t be persuaded to stay away
but one night. We’ll take her up to Caldwell this
evening to buy a few women’s fixings and show
her the best time we can but she’ll come traipsing
back home to-morrow. Can’t keep her away.
Carver had to promise to go over and stay all
night with Bart so no one could steal that homestead
while she’s gone.”</p>

<p>Nate Younger remarked similarly in Freel’s
saloon within earshot of the two Ralstons who
were refreshing themselves at the bar. In fact,
the two old cowmen mentioned the matter to a
number of acquaintances whom they chanced
across in a variety of places throughout town and
it was within an hour of noon before they took
Molly out to the fair.</p>

<p>The girl found the fair a mixture of the old
way and the new. The exhibits were those of the
settlers but the sports and amusements were
those of an earlier day, a condition which would
prevail for many a year. Every such annual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span>
event would witness an increase of agricultural
exhibits, fine stock and blooded horses as the
country aged; but at fair time, too, the old-time
riders of the unowned lands would come into their
own again for a single day. Then would bartenders
lay aside their white aprons, laborers
drop their tools and officers discard their stars,
donning instead the regalia of the cowboys.
Gaudy shirts and angora chaps would be resurrected
from the depths of ancient war bags.
Once more they would jangle boots and spurs
and twirl old reatas that had seen long service.
The spirit of the old days would prevail for a day
and a night and fairgoers would quit the exhibits
to watch the bronc fighters ride ’em to a standstill,
bulldog Texas longhorns and rope, bust and
hog-tie rangy steers, to cheer the relay and the
wild-horse races and all the rest of it; then a wild
night in town, ponies charging up and down the
streets to the accompaniment of shrill cowboy
yelps and the occasional crash of a gun fired into
the air,—then back to the white aprons and the
laborer’s tools for another year.</p>

<p>The girl and her two old companions spent the
day at the fair and in the early evening took a
train to Caldwell some two hours before Freel
and Wellman rode out of town. The evening’s
festivities were in full swing and none observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span>
their departure. Freel was nervous and excited.</p>

<p>“We’d better have sent some one else,” he said.</p>

<p>Wellman turned on him angrily.</p>

<p>“And have the thing bungled again!” he said.
“Damn your roundabout planning and never
doing anything yourself. If you hadn’t sent that
fool over to Alvin without letting me know we’d
have had it all over by now. Crowfoot told you
we’d have to do it ourselves. So did I. And if
you’d only waited we’d have found an opening
months back but that Alvin fluke made Carver
take cover and he’s never give us a chance at him
since. We wouldn’t even know there was one
to-night if those two old fossils hadn’t let it out
accidental.”</p>

<p>“But maybe that talk of theirs was—” Freel
began, but his companion interrupted and cut
short his complaint.</p>

<p>“We’ve give Carver time to do just what we
was to head him from doing—getting our names
linked with every deal we wanted kept quiet.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t prove a sentence of it in the next
fifteen years,” Freel asserted.</p>

<p>“He’s started folks thinking—and talking,”
said Wellman. “They’ll talk more every day.
It’s right now or never with me!”</p>

<p>“But it’s too late to make out that it’s an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>
arrest,” Freel protested. “After all that’s been
said.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I know,” said Wellman. “So
we’ll hurry it up and slip back into town. With
all that fair crowd milling around, there won’t be
one man that could testify we’d ever left town;
and I can produce several that’ll swear positive
that we’ve been there all along.”</p>

<p>They rode on in silence and they had not covered
a distance of three miles from town when
Mattison rode into the county seat at the head
of a half-dozen men,—men who, incidentally,
knew nothing whatever of his mission except that
they had been deputized to follow wherever he
led. As the marshal entered the outskirts of
town a figure detached itself from the shadows.
Mattison joined the man who reported in tones
that did not carry to the rest of the posse.</p>

<p>“They’ve gone,” he informed. “I followed
Freel every living minute till he and Wellman
slipped out of town together a half-hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Sure they didn’t change their plans and come
back?” Mattison asked.</p>

<p>“Dead sure,” the man stated positively.
“Not a chance.”</p>

<p>Mattison led his men direct to the county jail
and left them just outside the office while he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
entered alone. The two Ralstons occupied the
place at the time.</p>

<p>“Where’s Freel?” the marshal demanded.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t say,” one of the deputies answered.
“Out around town somewheres likely.” His
eyes rested apprehensively on the group of men
standing just outside the door. “You wanting
to see him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I was—somewhat,” Mattison admitted.
“I surmise you all know what about.”</p>

<p>The Ralstons denied this.</p>

<p>“We’ll go out and look him up,” Mattison decided.
“You two stay here. I might be wanting
to question you later.”</p>

<p>But the Ralstons failed to tarry. Within five
minutes after the marshal’s departure they set
forth from town and the county was minus the
services of two deputies who neglected even to
hand in their resignations before quitting their
posts.</p>

<p>A similar scene was enacted at Wellman’s
hotel. The crowd in the lobby turned suddenly
quiet as Mattison led his men in and inquired at
the desk for Wellman. The proprietor was not
to be found. The county attorney reclined in a
chair at one side of the lobby and Mattison
crossed over and addressed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>“Any idea where I could locate Wellman and
Freel?” he inquired.</p>

<p>The county attorney moistened his lips and disclaimed
all knowledge of their whereabouts. A
voice rose from the far end of the lobby, a voice
which Mattison recognized as that of the man
who had accosted him in the outskirts as he rode
into town.</p>

<p>“They got out ahead of you, Colonel,” the
man stated. “Your birds has flown.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” Mattison asked, turning to
face the informer. “How do you know?”</p>

<p>“Just by sheer accident,” the man reported.
“I see one party holding two horses just outside
of town. Another man joined him afoot. One
of ’em touched off a smoke, and in the flare of the
match I made out that they was Wellman and
Freel. They rode west.”</p>

<p>“That’s downright unfortunate,” Mattison
said. “But it don’t matter much. I was only
wanting to see them to gather a little information
they might be able to give. Another time
will do just as well.”</p>

<p>He turned and stared absently at the county
attorney and that gentleman’s florid countenance
turned a shade lighter.</p>

<p>“Don’t matter,” the marshal repeated, rousing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
from his seeming abstraction. “Nothing of any
importance.”</p>

<p>He led his men from the lobby and rode west
out of town. And out in the country toward
which he was heading were Carver and Bart Lassiter,
both prone in the grass a few yards apart
and as many from Bart’s homestead cabin.</p>

<p>“This is growing real tedious,” Bart stated.
“Whatever leads you to suspect that they’re
due to pay their call on just this particular
night?”</p>

<p>“They won’t if you keep on talking,” Carver
returned. “If you keep quiet they might.”</p>

<p>Bart lapsed into silence. He had already spent
a long hour in his present location and would
have preferred to be up and stirring about.
Another twenty minutes dragged by and he was
on the point of addressing Carver again when his
intended utterance was cut short by a slight
sound close at hand. Five more interminable
minutes passed and he heard a single soft footfall
a few feet away.</p>

<p>Two dim figures approached the house and
slipped silently to the door. The night was so
black that they seemed but two wavering patches
that merged with the surrounding obscurity.
One tested the latch and the door opened on
noiseless hinges. For a space both men stood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
there and listened. Then one entered while the
other remained at the door.</p>

<p>Carver spoke.</p>

<p>“What was you expecting to locate in there?”
he asked softly.</p>

<p>The man in the door whirled and fired at the
sound of his voice, the flash of his gun a crimson
streak in the velvet black of the night. Carver
shot back at the flash and Bart’s gun chimed with
the report of his own. There was a second flash
from the doorway but this time the crimson spurt
leaped skyward for the shot was fired as the man
sagged and fell forward. There was a splintering
crash of breaking glass as the man inside
cleared a window on the far side of the house.
Bart shot twice at the dim figure that moved
through the night, then rose to his feet intent
upon following but Carver restrained him.</p>

<p>“Let him go!” he ordered. “One’s enough!”</p>

<p>“But just why the hell should I let Freel get
away?” he demanded, pulling back from the detaining
hand which Carver had clamped on his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“It’s Wellman. Freel’s there by the door,”
Carver said.</p>

<p>“How can you tell? It’s too black to see,”
Bart insisted.</p>

<p>“Wellman would be the one to go in. Freel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
would be the one to hang back,” Carver said.
“That’s why I planned for you and me to stay
outside in the grass instead of waiting inside.
Wellman and me used to be friends—likely
would be still if it wasn’t for Freel. It makes a
difference, some way. Wellman’s harmless to us
from now on, outlawed for this night’s business.
He’ll be riding the hills with the wild bunch till
some one comes bringing him in.”</p>

<p>He stopped speaking to listen to the thud of
many hoofs pounding down the trail from the
ridge.</p>

<p>“Now I wonder who that will be,” he speculated.</p>

<p>“You know now,” Bart accused. “You always
know. Whoever it is didn’t come without
you had it planned in advance. But I’ll never
tell what I think.”</p>

<p>“No, I wouldn’t,” Carver advised.</p>

<p>Mattison reached the foot of the trail with his
men.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he inquired. “We’d just
stopped at the Half Diamond H to ask you to
put us up for the night. Nobody home. I
thought I might find you here so we’d just
started over when all that shooting set in and we
hustled along. You two out hunting for owls?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Carver said. “There’s one by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
door. The other one flew out the window. Bart
and I was reclining out here in the grass talking
things over when the pair of them eased up to
the door and one slipped on in. I asked how
about it and the man in the door started to shoot.
Then we did some shooting ourselves. The party
there by the door is our amiable sheriff.”</p>

<p>“Then the one that got off is Wellman,” one
of the posse spoke up. “Right from the first
shot I guessed it. I’ve heard it whispered round
that they was planning to get you, and when the
ruckus broke I was looking to find you two dead
when we got here. I’m glad they got it instead.
That whole county seat bunch needs cleaning
out.”</p>

<p>There was a chorus of assent from the posse
and under its cover Carver murmured to Bart.</p>

<p>“So much for background,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s a right queer bit of business for them two
to be at,” Mattison stated. “I’ll have to put off
gathering that information from Freel. You’d
better saddle up and ride on into town with me,
Carver, and we’ll report this affair to the county
attorney. You boys bring Freel in with you.
He’s likely got a horse tied round somewheres
close. Scout around till you find him. Yes,
we’ve been needing a change of officials at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
county seat for some time and it does look like
the alteration has been effected to-night.”</p>

<p>Carver rode off with the marshal.</p>

<p>“Thanks for going to all that bother,” Carver
said. “I’m indebted a lot.”</p>

<p>“It just evens that score,” said the marshal.
“And the whole thing worked out nice. It’ll
make a clean sweep in Oval Springs. Wellman
won’t show up any more. I’ll venture to predict
that the two Ralstons will have vanished from
these parts before morning and the county attorney
is scared into a state of palpitation right now.
He’ll attend to all the necessary formalities to see
that you’re given honorable mention instead of a
trial.”</p>

<p>“Then after we’ve finished with him I’ll take
the night train for Caldwell and loaf around a
few days,” Carver announced. “I haven’t traveled
to any extent for some time.”</p>

<p>It was nearly morning when the train pulled
into Caldwell.</p>

<p>“No use to go to bed now,” Carver decided.
“I’ll find some of the boys and set up.”</p>

<p>The Silver Dollar, now conducted in the rear
of a cigar store which had been fashioned across
the front of the building since the old, wide-open
days had become a thing of the past in Caldwell,
was still operated as an all-night place of amusement.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>
But Carver found that its grandeur had
vanished, the whole atmosphere of the place was
different. There were a dozen men in the place,
but of them all Carver saw not one of the riders
that had been wont to forgather here.</p>

<p>He drew a tarnished silver coin from his
pocket.</p>

<p>“Here’s where I got you and right here is
where I leave you,” he said. “You’ve sewed me
up for one year now and I’m about to get shut
of you before you cinch me for another. We’ll
spend you for a drink to the boys that used to
gather here. Back to your namesake, little silver
dollar.”</p>

<p>As he crossed to the bar he glanced at the
swinging side door that led into the adjoining
restaurant. It opened and a girl stood there,
motioning him to join her. He followed her outside.
Two horses stood at a hitch rail down the
street.</p>

<p>“Come on, Don; we’re going home,” she said.
Then, as he seemed not quite to understand,
“Didn’t Bart tell you?”</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “Whatever it was, Bart didn’t
tell me.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you myself on the way home,”
she promised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span>She linked an arm through his and moved
toward the two horses at the hitch rail.</p>

<p>“Tell me now,” he insisted, halting and swinging
her round to face him. “You can’t mean—but
I must be reading my signs wrong, some
way.”</p>

<p>“You’re reading them right,” she corrected.
“All those outside things don’t matter. I know
that now. We’re going home, Don, just you and
me. That’s all that counts.”</p>

<p>He had a swift, uneasy vision of the occurrences
of the night just past.</p>

<p>“But you haven’t heard—,” he commenced.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; I’ve heard,” she interrupted. “The
news was telephoned up here and was spread all
over Caldwell before you even took the train from
Oval Springs. That doesn’t matter either. Hinman
phoned to Mattison at the hotel and found
that you were coming. That’s how I knew and
why I was waiting up. I’ve rented those two
horses so we could ride instead of taking a train
to Oval Springs. I’d rather, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“We’ll start in just one minute, Honey,” he
said. “But first—”</p>

<p>She looked the length of the street and nodded,
for there was no one abroad.</p>

<p>Some miles out of Caldwell the girl pulled up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
her horse where the road crossed the point of a
hill.</p>

<p>“You remember?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I won’t forget,” he said.</p>

<p>For it was from this same point that they had
watched the last of the herds of the big cow outfits
held in the quarantine belt awaiting shipment,
the riders guarding them, the trail herds moving
up from the south, while over across had been that
solid line of camps where the settlers were waiting
to come in.</p>

<p>“We saw the sun set on the old days here,” she
said. “Let’s watch it rise on the new.”</p>

<p>For as far as they could see the lights were
flashing from the windows of early-rising settlers.
A boy was calling his cows. A rooster crowed
triumphant greeting to the red-gray streaks that
were showing in the east. There came a flapping
of wings as a flock of turkeys descended from
their perch on the ridgepole of a barn, then their
querulous yelping as the big birds prospected for
food in the barn lot.</p>

<p>“It’s different,” he said.</p>

<p>Then, from the road below them, came the clatter
of hoofs and riotous voices raised in song; a
few wild whoops and a gun fired in the air.</p>

<p>“The last few of the tumbleweeds, rattling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
their dry bones to impress the pumpkins,” Carver
said.</p>

<p>The words of the song drifted to them.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">I’m a wild, wild rider</div>

<div class="verse">And I kill off others slow;</div>
<div class="verse">It’s the only way I ever take my fun.</div>
</div></div>

<p>The girl’s thoughts drifted back to the big
Texan who had led the stampede and then presented
his claim to another. She leaned over and
rested a hand on Carver’s arm.</p>

<p>“I’m very much contented right now, Don,”
she said. “But so terribly sorry for the poor
tumbleweeds that have been crowded out.”</p>
